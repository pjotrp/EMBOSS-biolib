<h2>
Using the Interface</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Jemboss window is split into three panes. On the
left are the menus and alphabetical scroll list, for <b>selecting the emboss
applications</b>. The menu splits the programs into group with the name
of the program and a short description of what the program does. If you
are already familiar with the names of the programs the scroll list (bottom
left) may be quicker to use.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The central pane in the Jemboss window displays the
program parameters that the user would be presented with if running EMBOSS
from the command line. The user will need to fill in this and has the opportunity
to change any default parameters. To obtain more information and help for
an application there is a "HELP" button at the bottom of each program form.
Next to this is a "GO" button which will set the application running.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jemboss contains two separate file managers,
a local one, located in the right hand pane of the interface, and a remote
(or server) file manager, displayed in a separate window on demand. Both
these can be used to transfer files to the input field of an application,
using the drag &amp; drop method. Data may be displayed and edited by double
clicking on the relevant file.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jemboss incorporates the 100+ applications
of both the EMBOSS and EMBASSY packages.&nbsp; On initial program selection,
the program form will appear. An input file must be entered into the sequence
filename box, or pasted into the appropriate field. Various parameters
may be selected from the form. Advanced options may be selected from an
additional form. Parameter selections may be regulated according to the
input sequence, with unobtainable options shaded out, or omited from the
form altogether. Application output files appear in a separate window,
and can be saved to the local disk.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous outputs may be accessed from their
store on the server. The command line&nbsp; used to construct the analysis
is displayed, and the output data may be obtained, edited and saved. Unwanted
analyses should be deleted from this table.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <b>job manager </b>is used in the client server
mode. It is found at the bottom of the the EMBOSS program form. The middle
button can be used to look at all batch jobs submitted in a session. If
a application is designated batch then it will be sent to a batch queue.
If a job is designated interactive then it will be run interactively and
the client will wait for the results to be returned to the users screen.
