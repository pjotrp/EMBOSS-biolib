<!-- SUMMARY

SIGGENLIG reads a CON file of residue-ligand contacts generated by using SITES and a directory of CCF files (clean coordinate files) containing a CCF file for each protein or domain in the CON file.  One or more signature files, each containing a ligand-binding signature, are generated for <i>each</i> ligand-binding site in the CON file.  The user specifies whether 1D (sequence) or 3D (structural) signatures are generated and whether they are 'full-length' (signature corresponds to entire ligand-binding site) or 'patch' (signature corresponds to part of ligand-binding site).  For 3D signatures, the environment definition is specified and for patch signatures, a 'Minimum patch size' and 'Maximum gap distance' are specified. A 'Window size' is specified for all signatures. The paths of the CCF files (input) and signature files (output) are specified by the user and the file extensions are specified in the ACD file.  A log file is also written.



<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     appropriate.

<br><br><br><H2> 3.0   INPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>

The format of the CON file (contacts file) is described in <a href="sites.html">SITES documentation</a>.
The format of the CCF files is described in <a href="pdbparse.html">PDBPARSE documentation</a> (proteins) and the <a href="domainer.html">DOMAINER documentation</a> (domains).

<!-- OUTPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of output file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.  
     If the standard description of the avalable report formats is required, 
     use:   #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
     Use "Outputs a graph to the specified graphics device."

<br><br><br><H2> 4.0   OUTPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>

The output file (Figure 1) uses the standard signature file format and is described in the <a href="siggen.html">SIGGEN documentation</a>.  For the ligand-binding signatures generated by SIGGENLIG, however, four additional lines of bibliographic information taken from the CON (input) file are written to a signature file.  The records have the following meaning:

<UL>
<LI> ID - identifier codes: (1) PDB: 4-character PDB identifier code. (2) DOM: 7-character domain identifier code from SCOP or CATH. (3) LIG: Ligand identifier (an abbreviation of its full name).
<LI> DE - full name of the ligand, see <a href="hetparse.html">HETPARSE</a> documentation. 
<LI> IS - ligand-binding site information: (1) SN: Site number.  This uniquely identifies a ligand-binding site in the CON file generated by running SITES. (2) NS: The total number of binding sites for a given ligand.
<LI> IP - path information:  (1) PN: Patch number.  The sequential order (from the N-terminus) of the patch in the ligand-binding site. (2) NP: Number of patches. The total number of patches in this ligand-binding site.  (3) MP: Minimum patch size.  (4) MG: Maximum gap distance.  MP and MG were specified in the generation of the signature (see 'Algorithm' below). 
</UL>


In addition, where 3D signatures are generated, the following records have different meanings than for 1D signatures (e.g. those generated by using <a href="siggen.html">SIGGEN</a>):
<UL>
<LI> IN - Informative line about signature position. The number of different observed amino acid <i>environments</i> (rather than residue identities) is given after 'NRES'
<LI> AA - The identifier of an <i>environment</i> (rather than residue) seen in this position and the frequency of its occurence are delimited by ';'.
</UL>

<B>Window size</B>
<br>The user is prompted for a window size that is used for every position in the signature.  Likely this is not optimal. A future implementation will provide a range of methods for generating values of window size depending upon the alignment (window size is identified by the WSIZ record in the signature output file).

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
A protein or a single domain of a protein may contain one or more ligand-binding sites.  SIGGENLIG provides an automated means to generate signatures of ligand-binding from a CON file (contacts file) of residue-ligand contacts.  The signatures generated may be of two types, 1D or 3D.  1D signatures represent protein sites as residue identitites whereas 3D signatures represent sites as residue environments in space.



<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

The user specifies whether 1D (sequence) or 3D (structural) signatures are generated and whether they are 'full-length' (signature corresponds to entire ligand-binding site) or 'patch' (signature corresponds to part of ligand-binding site).  For 3D signatures, the environment definition is specified and for patch signatures, a 'Minimum patch size' and 'Maximum gap distance' are specified. A 'Window size' is specified for all signatures. 

<br><br><b>Definition of full-length and patch signatures</b><br>
For each ligand-binding site represented in the CON file (input), one or more signatures are generated as follows: (1) a single 'full-length' signature incorporating all residue positions that contact the ligand plus intervening gaps, or (2) one or more signatures corresponding to 'patches' of residue positions.

<br>
 A patch is a set of residues that are near-neighbours in sequence and is described by two user-defined parameters as follows. (1) Minimum patch size; the minimum number of contact positions that must be incorporated for a patch to be defined.   (2) Maximum gap distance.  The maximum allowable gap (residues) between two residue in a patch.  If two contact residues are further than this distance apart in sequence, they would not belong to the same patch.

<br><br><B>Environment definitions. </B>
<br>
See <a href="matgen3d.html">MATGEN3d</a> documentation for environment definitions.


<br><br><b>Naming of output files.</b>
The naming convention of the signature (output) files is as follows:<br>

<i>Ligand identifier</i>.<i>Site number</i>.<i>F</i> <b>or</b> <i>P</i>.<i>Patch number</i>-<i>Total patches</i>.<i>PDB identifier</i>.<i>Domain identifier</i>. 

<UL>
<LI>The <i>ligand identifier</i> is a 3-letter code that uniquely identifies the ligand.
<LI>The <i>site number</i> uniquely identifies a ligand-binding site in the CON file generated by running SITES.
<LI><i>F</i> signifies a 'Full-length' and <i>P</i> a 'Patch' signature. 
<LI><i>Patch number</i> is the sequential order (from the N-terminus) of the patch in the ligand-binding site. 
<LI><i>Total patches</i> is the total number of patches for this ligand-binding site.
The patch number and total number of patches are only specified for a 'patch'.
<LI>PDB identifier code.
<LI>Domain identifier code. Only specified if the binding site is mapped to SCOP.
</UL>

For example, 
<br>
101.1.P.1-1.1cs4.d1cs4a_.sig
