    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->
EMBASSY HMMER is a suite of application wrappers to the original hmmer v2.3.2 applications written by Sean Eddy. hmmer v2.3.2 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the hmmer executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY HMMER to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>ehmmemit [options] hmmfile outfile
<p>The outfile parameter is new to EMBASSY HMMER.  The synthetic sequences are always written to outfile. The name of outfile is specified by the -o option as normal.

<p>hmmemit reads an HMM file from a file <hmmfile> containing one or more HMMs, and generates a number of sequences from each HMM; or, if the -c option is selected, generate a single majority-rule consensus. This can be useful for various applications in which one needs a simulation of sequences consistent with a sequence family consensus. By default, hmmemit generates 10 sequences and outputs them in FASTA (unaligned) format file <outfile>.

    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->

<!--#include file="inc/ehmmemit.usage" -->



<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter order is used as in the original hmmer.  There are however several unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the "Notes" section below.
<p>More or less all options documented as "expert" in the original hmmer user guide are given in ACD as "advanced" options (-options must be specified on the command-line in order to be prompted for a value for them).

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<H3>Alignment and sequence formats </H3>
Input and output of alignments and sequences is limited to the formats that the original hmmer supports. These include stockholm, SELEX, MSF, Clustal, Phylip and A2M /aligned FASTA (alignments) and FASTA, GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR (sequences).  It would be fairly straightforward to adapt the code to support all EMBOSS-supported formats. 

<H3>Compressed input files </H3>
Automatic processing of gzipped files is not supported. 
<p>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>ehmmemit</b> reads any normal sequence USAs.

        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what

	report formats, use:

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->
<H3>1. Command-line arguments</H3>
The following original HMMER options are not supported:
<br><pre>
-h         : Use -help to get help information instead.
-n         : Use -nseq instead (-n causes problems for GUI developers)
</pre>


<H3>2. Installing EMBASSY HMMER</H3>
The EMBASSY HMMER package contains "wrapper" applications providing an EMBOSS-style interface to the applications in the original HMMER package version 2.3.2 developed by Sean Eddy.  Please read the file INSTALL in the EMBASSY HMMER package distribution for installation instructions.

<H3>3. Installing original HMMER</H3>
To use EMBASSY HMMER, you will first need to download and install the original HMMER package.  Please read the file 00README in the the original HMMER package distribution for installation instructions:
<pre>
WWW home:       http://hmmer.wustl.edu/
Distribution:   ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/
</pre>

<H3>4. Setting up HMMER</H3>
For the EMBASSY HMMER package to work, the directory containing the original HMMER executables *must* be in your path. For example if you executables were installed to "/usr/local/hmmer/bin", then type:
<pre>
set path=(/usr/local/hmmer/bin/ $path)
rehash
</pre>

<H3> 5. Getting help </H3>
Please read the Userguide.pdf distributed with the original HMMER and included in the EMBASSY HMMER distribution under the DOCS directory. The first 3 chapters (Introduction, Installation and Tutorial) are particularly useful.
<p>Please read the 'Notes' section below for a description of the differences between the original and EMBASSY HMMER, particularly which application command line options are supported.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->
<H3>Types of input data</H3>
hmmer v3.2.1 and therefore EMBASSY HMMER is only recommended for use with protein sequences.  If you provide a non-protein sequence you will be reprompted for a protein sequence.  To accept nucleic acid sequences you must replace instances of < type: "protein" > in the application ACD files with <type: "nucleic" >.

<H3>Environment variables</H3>
The original hmmer uses BLAST environment variables (below), if defined, to locate files. The EMBASSY HMMER does not.
<pre>
BLASTDB   location of sequence databases to be searched
BLASMAT   location of substitution matrices
HMMERDB   location of HMMs
</pre>
