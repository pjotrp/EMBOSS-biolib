        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->
EMBASSY HMMER is a suite of application wrappers to the original hmmer v2.3.2 applications written by Sean Eddy. hmmer v2.3.2 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the hmmer executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY HMMER to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>ehmmbuild [options] alignfile hmmfile 
<p>Important note: the alignfile (input) and hmmfile (output) parameters are specified in the reverse order in the original HMMER. 

<p>hmmbuild reads a multiple sequence alignment file <alignfile>, builds a new profile HMM, and saves the HMM to file <hmmfile>. By default, the model is confgured to find one or more nonoverlapping alignments to the complete model: multiple global alignments with respect to the model, and local with respect to the sequence. This is analogous to the behavior of the hmmls program of HMMER 1. To confgure the model for multiple local alignments with respect to the model and local with respect to the sequence, a la the old program hmmfs, use the -f (fragment) option. More rarely, you may want to confgure the model for a single global alignment (global with respect to both model and sequence), using the -g option; or to confgure the model for a single local/local alignment (a la standard Smith/Waterman, or the old hmmsw program), use the -s option.

                                  the default mixture Dirichlet. The format of
                                  prior files is documented in the User's
                                  Guide, and an example is given in the Demos
                                  directory of the HMMER distribution.
   -null               infile     Read a null model from file. The default for
                                  protein is to use average amino acid
                                  frequencies from Swissprot 34 and p1 =
                                  350/351; for nucleic acid, the default is to
                                  use 0.25 for each base and p1 = 1000/1001.
                                  For documentation of the format of the null
                                  model file and further explanation of how
                                  the null model is used, see the User's
                                  Guide.
   -pam                infile     Apply a heuristic PAM- (substitution
                                  matrix-) based prior on match emission
                                  probabilities instead of the default mixture
                                  Dirichlet. The substitution matrix is read
                                  from file. See -pamwgt. The default
                                  Dirichlet state transition prior and insert
                                  emission prior are unaffected. Therefore in
                                  principle you could combine -prior with -pam
                                  but this isn't recommended, as it hasn't
                                  been tested. ( -pam itself hasn't been
                                  tested much!)
   -pamwgt             float      [20.0] Controls the weight <x> on a
                                  PAM-based prior. Only has effect if -pam
                                  option is also in use. <x> is a positive
                                  real number, 20.0 by default. <x> is the
                                  number of 'pseudocounts' contriubuted by the
                                  heuristic prior. Very high values of <x>
                                  can force a scoring system that is entirely
                                  driven by the substitution matrix, making
                                  HMMER somewhat approximate Gribskov
                                  profiles. (Any numeric value)
   -pbswitch           integer    [1000] For alignments with a very large
                                  number of sequences, the GSC, BLOSUM, and
                                  Voronoi weighting schemes are slow; they're
                                  O(N^2) for N sequences. Henikoff
                                  position-based weights (PB weights) are more
                                  effcient. At or above a certain threshold
                                  sequence number <n> hmmbuild will switch
                                  from GSC, BLOSUM, or Voronoi weights to PB
                                  weights. To disable this switching behavior
                                  (at the cost of compute time, set <n> to be
                                  something larger than the number of

                                  positive integer; the default is 1000. (Any

   -archpri            float      [0.85] The value of the 'architecture prior'
                                  used by MAP architecture construction. This
                                  value is a probability between 0 and 1.
                                  This parameter governs a geometric prior
                                  distribution over model lengths. As
                                  'archpri' increases, longer models are
                                  favored a priori. As 'archpri' decreases, it
                                  takes more residue conservation in a column
                                  to make a column a 'consensus' match column
                                  in the model architecture. The 0.85 default
                                  has been chosen empirically as a reasonable
                                  setting. (Any numeric value)
   -binary             boolean    [N] Write the HMM to file in HMMER binary
                                  format instead of readable ASCII text.
   -fast               boolean    [N] Quickly and heuristically determine the
                                  architecture of the model by assigning all
                                  columns with more than a certain fraction of
                                  gap characters to insert states. By default
                                  this fraction is 0.5, and it can be changed
                                  using the --gapmax option. The default
                                  construction algorithm is a maximum a
                                  posteriori (MAP) algorithm, which is slower.
   -gapmax             float      [0.5] Controls the -fast model construction
                                  algorithm, but if -fast is not being used,
                                  has no effect. If a column has more than a
                                  fraction <x> of gap symbols in it, it gets
                                  assigned to an insert column. <x> is a
                                  frequency from 0 to 1, and by default is set
                                  to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean more
                                  columns get assigned to consensus, and
                                  models get longer; smaller values of <x>
                                  mean fewer columns get assigned to
                                  consensus, and models get smaller. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -hand               boolean    [N] Specify the architecture of the model by
                                  hand: the alignment file must be in SELEX
                                  or Stockholm format, and the reference
                                  annotation line (RF in SELEX, GC RF in
                                  Stockholm) is used to specify the
                                  architecture. Any column marked with a
                                  non-gap symbol (such as an 'x', for
                                  instance) is assigned as a consensus (match)
                                  column in the model.
   -sidlevel           float      [0.62] Controls both the determination of
                                  effective sequence number and the behavior
                                  of the -wblosum weighting option. The
                                  sequence alignment is clustered by percent
                                  identity, and the number of clusters at a
                                  cutoff threshold of <x> is used to determine
                                  the effective sequence number. Higher
                                  values of <x> give more clusters and higher
                                  effective sequence numbers; lower values of
                                  <x> give fewer clusters and lower effective
                                  sequence numbers. <x> is a fraction from 0
                                  to 1, and by default is set to 0.62
                                  (corresponding to the clustering level used
                                  in constructing the BLOSUM62 substitution
                                  matrix). (Any numeric value)
   -noeff              boolean    [N] Turn off the effective sequence number
                                  calculation, and use the true number of
                                  sequences instead. This will usually reduce
                                  the sensitivity of the final model (so don't
                                  do it without good reason!)
   -swentry            float      [0.5] Controls the total probability that is
                                  distributed to local entries into the
                                  model, versus starting at the beginning of
                                  the model as in a global alignment. <x> is a
                                  probability from 0 to 1, and by default is
                                  set to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean that
                                  hits that are fragments on their left (N or
                                  5'-terminal) side will be penalized less,
                                  but complete global alignments will be
                                  penalized more. Lower values of <x> mean
                                  that fragments on the left will be penalized
                                  more, and global alignments on this side
                                  will be favored. This option only affects
                                  the confgurations that allow local
                                  alignments, e.g. -s and -f; unless one of
                                  these options is also activated, this option
                                  has no effect. You have independent control
                                  over local/global alignment behavior for
                                  the N/C (5'/3') termini of your target
                                  sequences using --swentry and --swexit. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -swexit             float      [0.5] Controls the total probability that is
                                  distributed to local exits from the model,
                                  versus ending an alignment at the end of the
                                  model as in a global alignment. <x> is a
                                  probability from 0 to 1, and by default is
                                  set to 0.5. Higher values of <x> mean that
                                  hits that are fragments on their right (C or
                                  3'-terminal) side will be penalized less,
                                  but complete global alignments will be
                                  penalized more. Lower values of <x> mean
                                  that fragments on the right will be
                                  penalized more, and global alignments on
                                  this side will be favored. This option only
                                  affects the confgurations that allow local
                                  alignments, e.g. -s and -f; unless one of

                                  has no effect. You have independent control
                                  over local/global alignment behavior for
                                  the N/C (5'/3') termini of your target
                                  sequences using -swentry and -swexit. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -verbosity          boolean    [N] Print more possibly useful stuff, such
                                  as the individual scores for each sequence
                                  in the alignment.
   -weighting          menu       [G] Values (B)(-wblosum in HMMER) Use the
                                  BLOSUM filtering algorithm to weight the
                                  sequences. Cluster the sequences at a given
                                  percentage identity (see -idlevel); assign
                                  each cluster a total weight of 1.0,
                                  distributed equally amongst the members of
                                  that cluster. (G)(-wgsc in HMMER) Use the
                                  Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia ad hoc sequence
                                  weighting algorithm. This is the default.
                                  (K)(-wme in HMMER) Use the Krogh/Mitchison
                                  maximum entropy algorithm to 'weight' the
                                  sequences. This supercedes the
                                  Eddy/Mitchison/Durbin maximum discrimination
                                  algorithm, which gives almost identical
                                  weights but is less robust. ME weighting
                                  seems to give a marginal increase in
                                  sensitivity over the default GSC weights,
                                  but takes a fair amount of time. (W) (-wpb
                                  in HMMER) Use the Henikoff position-based
                                  weighting scheme. (V) (-wvoronoi in HMMER)
                                  Use the Sibbald/Argos Voronoi sequence
                                  weighting algorithm in place of the default
                                  GSC weighting. (N) (-wnone in HMMER) Turn
                                  off all sequence weighting. (Values: B
                                  (Blosum); G (Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia); K

   -o                  outfile    [*.ehmmbuild] Re-save the starting alignment
                                  to file, in Stockholm format. The columns
                                  which were assigned to match states will be
                                  marked with x's in an RF annotation line. If
                                  either the -hand or -fast construction
                                  options were chosen, the alignment may have
                                  been slightly altered to be compatible with
                                  Plan 7 transitions, so saving the final
                                  alignment and comparing to the starting
                                  alignment can let you view these
                                  alterations. See the User's Guide for more
                                  information on this arcane side effect.
   -cfile              outfile    [*.ehmmbuild] Save the observed emission and
                                  transition counts to file after the
                                  architecture has been determined (e.g. after
                                  residues/gaps have been assigned to match,
                                  delete, and insert states). This option is
                                  used in HMMER development for generating
                                  data files useful for training new Dirichlet
                                  priors. The format of count files is
                                  documented in the User's Guide.

<td>-prior</td>
<td>Read a Dirichlet prior from file, replacing the default mixture Dirichlet. The format of prior files is documented in the User's Guide, and an example is given in the Demos directory of the HMMER distribution.</td>
<td>Input file</td>
<td><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-null</td>
<td>Read a null model from file. The default for protein is to use average amino acid frequencies from Swissprot 34 and p1 = 350/351; for nucleic acid, the default is to use 0.25 for each base and p1 = 1000/1001. For documentation of the format of the null model file and further explanation of how the null model is used, see the User's Guide.</td>
<td>Input file</td>
<td><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-pam</td>
<td>Apply a heuristic PAM- (substitution matrix-) based prior on match emission probabilities instead of the default mixture Dirichlet. The substitution matrix is read from file. See -pamwgt. The default Dirichlet state transition prior and insert emission prior are unaffected. Therefore in principle you could combine -prior with -pam but this isn't recommended, as it hasn't been tested. ( -pam itself hasn't been tested much!)</td>
<td>Input file</td>
<td><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-pamwgt</td>
<td>Controls the weight &lt;x&gt; on a PAM-based prior. Only has effect if -pam option is also in use. &lt;x&gt; is a positive real number, 20.0 by default. &lt;x&gt; is the number of 'pseudocounts' contriubuted by the heuristic prior. Very high values of &lt;x&gt; can force a scoring system that is entirely driven by the substitution matrix, making HMMER somewhat approximate Gribskov profiles.</td>
<td>Any numeric value</td>
<td>20.0</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-pbswitch</td>
<td>For alignments with a very large number of sequences, the GSC, BLOSUM, and Voronoi weighting schemes are slow; they're O(N^2) for N sequences. Henikoff position-based weights (PB weights) are more effcient. At or above a certain threshold sequence number &lt;n&gt; hmmbuild will switch from GSC, BLOSUM, or Voronoi weights to PB weights. To disable this switching behavior (at the cost of compute time, set &lt;n&gt; to be something larger than the number of sequences in your alignment. &lt;n&gt; is a positive integer; the default is 1000.</td>
<td>Any integer value</td>
<td>1000</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-archpri</td>
<td>The value of the 'architecture prior' used by MAP architecture construction. This value is a probability between 0 and 1. This parameter governs a geometric prior distribution over model lengths. As 'archpri' increases, longer models are favored a priori. As 'archpri' decreases, it takes more residue conservation in a column to make a column a 'consensus' match column in the model architecture. The 0.85 default has been chosen empirically as a reasonable setting.</td>
<td>Any numeric value</td>
<td>0.85</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-binary</td>
<td>Write the HMM to file in HMMER binary format instead of readable ASCII text.</td>
<td>Boolean value Yes/No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-fast</td>
<td>Quickly and heuristically determine the architecture of the model by assigning all columns with more than a certain fraction of gap characters to insert states. By default this fraction is 0.5, and it can be changed using the --gapmax option. The default construction algorithm is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, which is slower.</td>
<td>Boolean value Yes/No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-gapmax</td>
<td>Controls the -fast model construction algorithm, but if -fast is not being used, has no effect. If a column has more than a fraction &lt;x&gt; of gap symbols in it, it gets assigned to an insert column. &lt;x&gt; is a frequency from 0 to 1, and by default is set to 0.5. Higher values of &lt;x&gt; mean more columns get assigned to consensus, and models get longer; smaller values of &lt;x&gt; mean fewer columns get assigned to consensus, and models get smaller.</td>
<td>Any numeric value</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-hand</td>
<td>Specify the architecture of the model by hand: the alignment file must be in SELEX or Stockholm format, and the reference annotation line (RF in SELEX, GC RF in Stockholm) is used to specify the architecture. Any column marked with a non-gap symbol (such as an 'x', for instance) is assigned as a consensus (match) column in the model.</td>
<td>Boolean value Yes/No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-sidlevel</td>
<td>Controls both the determination of effective sequence number and the behavior of the -wblosum weighting option. The sequence alignment is clustered by percent identity, and the number of clusters at a cutoff threshold of &lt;x&gt; is used to determine the effective sequence number. Higher values of &lt;x&gt; give more clusters and higher effective sequence numbers; lower values of &lt;x&gt; give fewer clusters and lower effective sequence numbers. &lt;x&gt; is a fraction from 0 to 1, and by default is set to 0.62 (corresponding to the clustering level used in constructing the BLOSUM62 substitution matrix).</td>
<td>Any numeric value</td>
<td>0.62</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-noeff</td>
<td>Turn off the effective sequence number calculation, and use the true number of sequences instead. This will usually reduce the sensitivity of the final model (so don't do it without good reason!)</td>
<td>Boolean value Yes/No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-swentry</td>
<td>Controls the total probability that is distributed to local entries into the model, versus starting at the beginning of the model as in a global alignment. &lt;x&gt; is a probability from 0 to 1, and by default is set to 0.5. Higher values of &lt;x&gt; mean that hits that are fragments on their left (N or 5'-terminal) side will be penalized less, but complete global alignments will be penalized more. Lower values of &lt;x&gt; mean that fragments on the left will be penalized more, and global alignments on this side will be favored. This option only affects the confgurations that allow local alignments, e.g. -s and -f; unless one of these options is also activated, this option has no effect. You have independent control over local/global alignment behavior for the N/C (5'/3') termini of your target sequences using --swentry and --swexit.</td>
<td>Any numeric value</td>
<td>0.5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-swexit</td>
<td>Controls the total probability that is distributed to local exits from the model, versus ending an alignment at the end of the model as in a global alignment. &lt;x&gt; is a probability from 0 to 1, and by default is set to 0.5. Higher values of &lt;x&gt; mean that hits that are fragments on their right (C or 3'-terminal) side will be penalized less, but complete global alignments will be penalized more. Lower values of &lt;x&gt; mean that fragments on the right will be penalized more, and global alignments on this side will be favored. This option only affects the confgurations that allow local alignments, e.g. -s and -f; unless one of these options is also activated, this option has no effect. You have independent control over local/global alignment behavior for the N/C (5'/3') termini of your target sequences using -swentry and -swexit.</td>

<tr>
<td>-verbosity</td>
<td>Print more possibly useful stuff, such as the individual scores for each sequence in the alignment.</td>
<td>Boolean value Yes/No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-weighting</td>
<td>Values (B)(-wblosum in HMMER) Use the BLOSUM filtering algorithm to weight the sequences. Cluster the sequences at a given percentage identity (see -idlevel); assign each cluster a total weight of 1.0, distributed equally amongst the members of that cluster. (G)(-wgsc in HMMER) Use the Gerstein/Sonnhammer/Chothia ad hoc sequence weighting algorithm. This is the default. (K)(-wme in HMMER) Use the Krogh/Mitchison maximum entropy algorithm to 'weight' the sequences. This supercedes the Eddy/Mitchison/Durbin maximum discrimination algorithm, which gives almost identical weights but is less robust. ME weighting seems to give a marginal increase in sensitivity over the default GSC weights, but takes a fair amount of time. (W) (-wpb in HMMER) Use the Henikoff position-based weighting scheme. (V) (-wvoronoi in HMMER) Use the Sibbald/Argos Voronoi sequence weighting algorithm in place of the default GSC weighting. (N) (-wnone in HMMER) Turn off all sequence weighting.</td>

<tr>
<td>-o</td>
<td>Re-save the starting alignment to file, in Stockholm format. The columns which were assigned to match states will be marked with x's in an RF annotation line. If either the -hand or -fast construction options were chosen, the alignment may have been slightly altered to be compatible with Plan 7 transitions, so saving the final alignment and comparing to the starting alignment can let you view these alterations.

    Input file format
</H2>
<H3>Alignment and sequence formats </H3>
Input and output of alignments and sequences is limited to the formats that the original hmmer supports. These include stockholm, SELEX, MSF, Clustal, Phylip and A2M /aligned FASTA (alignments) and FASTA, GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR (sequences).  It would be fairly straightforward to adapt the code to support all EMBOSS-supported formats. 

<H3>Compressed input files </H3>
Automatic processing of gzipped files is not supported. 
<p>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

<H3>2. Installing EMBASSY HMMER</H3>
The EMBASSY HMMER package contains "wrapper" applications providing an EMBOSS-style interface to the applications in the original HMMER package version 2.3.2 developed by Sean Eddy.  Please read the file INSTALL in the EMBASSY HMMER package distribution for installation instructions.

<H3>3. Installing original HMMER</H3>
To use EMBASSY HMMER, you will first need to download and install the original HMMER package.  Please read the file 00README in the the original HMMER package distribution for installation instructions:
<pre>
WWW home:       http://hmmer.wustl.edu/
Distribution:   ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/
</pre>

<H3>4. Setting up HMMER</H3>
For the EMBASSY HMMER package to work, the directory containing the original HMMER executables *must* be in your path. For example if you executables were installed to "/usr/local/hmmer/bin", then type:
<pre>
set path=(/usr/local/hmmer/bin/ $path)
rehash
</pre>

<H3> 5. Getting help </H3>
Please read the Userguide.pdf distributed with the original HMMER and included in the EMBASSY HMMER distribution under the DOCS directory. The first 3 chapters (Introduction, Installation and Tutorial) are particularly useful.
<p>Please read the 'Notes' section below for a description of the differences between the original and EMBASSY HMMER, particularly which application command line options are supported.

<H3>Types of input data</H3>
hmmer v3.2.1 and therefore EMBASSY HMMER is only recommended for use with protein sequences.  If you provide a non-protein sequence you will be reprompted for a protein sequence.  To accept nucleic acid sequences you must replace instances of < type: "protein" > in the application ACD files with <type: "nucleic" >.

<H3>Environment variables</H3>
The original hmmer uses BLAST environment variables (below), if defined, to locate files. The EMBASSY HMMER does not.
<pre>
BLASTDB   location of sequence databases to be searched
BLASMAT   location of substitution matrices
HMMERDB   location of HMMs
</pre>

<H3>Alignment input</H3>
The user must provide the full filename of an alignment for the "alignfile" ACD option, not an indirect reference to a set of sequences, e.g. a USA is NOT acceptable.  This is because hmmbuild (which ehmmbuild wraps) requires an alignment and does not support USAs.

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Sean Eddy
as part of his HMMER package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.
