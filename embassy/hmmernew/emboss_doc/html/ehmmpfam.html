  -->
EMBASSY HMMER is a suite of application wrappers to the original hmmer v2.3.2 applications written by Sean Eddy. hmmer v2.3.2 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the hmmer executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY HMMER to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>ehmmpfam [options] hmmfile seqfile outfile
<p>The outfile parameter is new to EMBASSY HMMER.

<p>hmmpfam reads a sequence file <seqfile> and compares each sequence in it, one at a time, against all the HMMs in a file <hmmfile> looking for signifcantly similar sequence matches.  hmmfile will be looked for first in the current working directory, then in a directory named by the environment variable HMMERDB. This lets administrators install HMM library(s) such as Pfam in a common location.  There is a separate output report (written to file <outfile> for each sequence in seqfile. This report consists of three sections: a ranked list of the best scoring HMMs, a list of the best scoring domains in order of their occurrence in the sequence, and alignments for all the best scoring domains. A sequence score may be higher than a domain score for the same sequence if there is more than one domain in the sequence; the sequence score takes into account all the domains. All sequences scoring above the -E and -T cutoffs are shown in the first list, then every domain found in this list is shown in the second list of domain hits. If desired, E-value and bit score thresholds may also be applied to the domain list using the -domE and -domT options.

Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter order is used as in the original hmmer.  There are however several unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the "Notes" section below.
<p>More or less all options documented as "expert" in the original hmmer user guide are given in ACD as "advanced" options (-options must be specified on the command-line in order to be prompted for a value for them).

<pre>
Search one or more sequences against an HMM database.
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-hmmfile]           infile     File of HMMs.
  [-seqfile]           seqall     File of sequences.
   -a                  integer    [100] Limits the alignment output to the <n>
                                  best scoring domains. -A0 shuts off the
                                  alignment output and can be used to reduce
                                  the size of output files. (Any integer
                                  value)
   -e                  float      [10.] Set the E-value cutoff for the
                                  per-sequence ranked hit list to <x>, where
                                  <x> is a positive real number. The default
                                  is 10.0. Hits with E-values better than
                                  (less than) this threshold will be shown.
                                  (Any numeric value)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.ehmmpfam] There is a separate output
                                  report for each sequence in seqfile. This
                                  report consists of three sections: a ranked
                                  list of the best scoring HMMs, a list of the
                                  best scoring domains in order of their
                                  occurrence in the sequence, and alignments
                                  for all the best scoring domains.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -nuc                boolean    [N] Specify that models and sequence are
                                  nucleic acid, not protein. Other HMMER
                                  programs autodetect this; but because of the
                                  order in which hmmpfam accesses data, it
                                  can't reliably determine the correct
                                  'alphabet' by itself.
   -t                  float      [-1000000.] Set the bit score cutoff for the
                                  per-sequence ranked hit list to <x>, where
                                  <x> is a real number. The default is
                                  negative infinity; by default, the threshold
                                  is controlled by E-value and not by bit
                                  score. Hits with bit scores better than
                                  (greater than) this threshold will be shown.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -z                  integer    [59021] Calculate the E-value scores as if
                                  we had seen a sequence database of <n>
                                  sequences. The default is arbitrarily set to
                                  59021, the size of Swissprot 34. (Any
                                  integer value)

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -acc                boolean    [N] Report HMM accessions instead of names
                                  in the output reports. Useful for
                                  high-throughput annotation, where the data
                                  are being parsed for storage in a relational
                                  database.
   -compat             boolean    [N] Use the output format of HMMER 2.1.1,
                                  the 1998-2001 public release; provided so
                                  2.1.1 parsers don't have to be rewritten.
   -cpu                integer    [0] Sets the maximum number of CPUs that the
                                  program will run on. The default is to use
                                  all CPUs in the machine. Overrides the HMMER
                                  NCPU environment variable. Only affects
                                  threaded versions of HMMER (the default on
                                  most systems). (Any integer value)
   -cutga              boolean    [N] Use Pfam GA (gathering threshold) score
                                  cutoffs. Equivalent to -globT <GA1> -domT
                                  <GA2>, but the GA1 and GA2 cutoffs are read
                                  from each HMM in the input HMM database
                                  individually. hmmbuild puts these cutoffs
                                  there if the alignment file was annotated in
                                  a Pfam-friendly alignment format (extended
                                  SELEX or Stockholm format) and the optional
                                  GA annotation line was present. If these
                                  cutoffs are not set in the HMM file, -cut ga
                                  doesn't work.
   -cuttc              boolean    [N] Use Pfam TC (trusted cutoff) score
                                  cutoffs. Equivalent to -globT <TC1> -domT
                                  <TC2>, but the TC1 and TC2 cutoffs are read
                                  from each HMM in hmmfile individually.
                                  hmmbuild puts these cutoffs there if the
                                  alignment file was annotated in a
                                  Pfam-friendly alignment format (extended
                                  SELEX or Stockholm format) and the optional
                                  TC annotation line was present. If these
                                  cutoffs are not set in the HMM file, -cut tc
                                  doesn't work.
   -cutnc              boolean    [N] Use Pfam NC (noise cutoff) score
                                  cutoffs. Equivalent to -globT <NC1> -domT
                                  <NC2>, but the NC1 and NC2 cutoffs are read
                                  from each HMM in hmmfile individually.
                                  hmmbuild puts these cutoffs there if the
                                  alignment file was annotated in a
                                  Pfam-friendly alignment format (extended
                                  SELEX or Stockholm format) and the optional
                                  NC annotation line was present. If these
                                  cutoffs are not set in the HMM file, -cut nc
                                  doesn't work.
   -dome               float      [1000000.] Set the E-value cutoff for the
                                  per-domain ranked hit list to <x>, where <x>
                                  is a positive real number. The default is
                                  infinity; by default, all domains in the
                                  sequences that passed the frst threshold
                                  will be reported in the second list, so that
                                  the number of domains reported in the
                                  per-sequence list is consistent with the
                                  number that appear in the per-domain list.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -domt               float      [-1000000.] Set the bit score cutoff for the
                                  per-domain ranked hit list to <x>, where
                                  <x> is a real number. The default is
                                  negative infinity; by default, all domains
                                  in the sequences that passed the frst
                                  threshold will be reported in the second
                                  list, so that the number of domains reported
                                  in the per-sequence list is consistent with
                                  the number that appear in the per-domain
                                  list. Important note: only one domain in a
                                  sequence is absolutely controlled by this
                                  parameter, or by --domT. The second and
                                  subsequent domains in a sequence have a de
                                  facto bit score threshold of 0 because of
                                  the details of how HMMER works. HMMER
                                  requires at least one pass through the main
                                  model per sequence; to do more than one pass
                                  (more than one domain) the multidomain
                                  alignment must have a better score than the
                                  single domain alignment, and hence the extra
                                  domains must contribute positive score. See
                                  the Users' Guide for more detail. (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -forward            boolean    [N] Use the Forward algorithm instead of the
                                  Viterbi algorithm to determine the
                                  per-sequence scores. Per-domain scores are
                                  still determined by the Viterbi algorithm.
                                  Some have argued that Forward is a more
                                  sensitive algorithm for detecting remote
                                  sequence homologues; my experiments with
                                  HMMER have not confrmed this, however.
   -nulltwo            boolean    [N] Turn off the post hoc second null model.
                                  By default, each alignment is rescored by a
                                  postprocessing step that takes into account
                                  possible biased composition in either the
                                  HMM or the target sequence. This is almost
                                  essential in database searches, especially
                                  with local alignment models. There is a very
                                  small chance that this postprocessing might
                                  remove real matches, and in these cases
                                  --null2 may improve sensitivity at the
                                  expense of reducing specifcity by letting
                                  biased composition hits through.
   -pvm                boolean    [N] Run on a Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM).
                                  The PVM must already be running. The client
                                  program hmmpfam-pvm must be installed on
                                  all the PVM nodes. The HMM database hmmfile
                                  and an associated GSI index file hmmfile.gsi
                                  must also be installed on all the PVM
                                  nodes. (The GSI index is produced by the
                                  program hmmindex.) Because the PVM
                                  implementation is I/O bound, it is highly
                                  recommended that each node have a local copy
                                  of hmmfile rather than NFS mounting a
                                  shared copy. Optional PVM support must have
                                  been compiled into HMMER for -pvm to
                                  function.

The default is negative infinity; by default, all domains in the sequences that passed the frst threshold will be reported in the second list, so that the number of domains reported in the per-sequence list is consistent with the number that appear in the per-domain list. Important note: only one domain in a sequence is absolutely controlled by this parameter, or by --domT. The second and subsequent domains in a sequence have a de facto bit score threshold of 0 because of the details of how HMMER works. HMMER requires at least one pass through the main model per sequence; to do more than one pass (more than one domain) the multidomain alignment must have a better score than the single domain alignment, and hence the extra domains must contribute positive score. See the Users' Guide for more detail.</td>

</tr>

<tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<td>-nulltwo</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Turn off the post hoc second null model. By default, each alignment is rescored by a postprocessing step that takes into account possible biased composition in either the HMM or the target sequence. This is almost essential in database searches, especially with local alignment models. There is a very small chance that this postprocessing might remove real matches, and in these cases --null2 may improve sensitivity at the expense of reducing specifcity by letting biased composition hits through.</td>

<tr bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<td>-pvm</td>

<td>Run on a Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM). The PVM must already be running. The client program hmmpfam-pvm must be installed on all the PVM nodes. The HMM database hmmfile and an associated GSI index file hmmfile.gsi must also be installed on all the PVM nodes. (The GSI index is produced by the program hmmindex.) Because the PVM implementation is I/O bound, it is highly recommended that each node have a local copy of hmmfile rather than NFS mounting a shared copy. Optional PVM support must have been compiled into HMMER for -pvm to function.</td>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<H3>Alignment and sequence formats </H3>
Input and output of alignments and sequences is limited to the formats that the original hmmer supports. These include stockholm, SELEX, MSF, Clustal, Phylip and A2M /aligned FASTA (alignments) and FASTA, GENBANK, EMBL, GCG, PIR (sequences).  It would be fairly straightforward to adapt the code to support all EMBOSS-supported formats. 

<H3>Compressed input files </H3>
Automatic processing of gzipped files is not supported. 
<p>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->
<H3>1. Command-line arguments</H3>
The following original HMMER options are not supported:
<br><pre>
-h         : Use -help to get help information instead.
-informat  : All common sequence file formats are supported automatically.
-n         : Use -nuc instead (-n causes problems for GUI developers)
</pre>

<p>
The following additional options are provided:
<br><pre>
-outfile   : Output file with HMM.
</pre>


<H3>2. Installing EMBASSY HMMER</H3>
The EMBASSY HMMER package contains "wrapper" applications providing an EMBOSS-style interface to the applications in the original HMMER package version 2.3.2 developed by Sean Eddy.  Please read the file INSTALL in the EMBASSY HMMER package distribution for installation instructions.

<H3>3. Installing original HMMER</H3>
To use EMBASSY HMMER, you will first need to download and install the original HMMER package.  Please read the file 00README in the the original HMMER package distribution for installation instructions:
<pre>
WWW home:       http://hmmer.wustl.edu/
Distribution:   ftp://ftp.genetics.wustl.edu/pub/eddy/hmmer/
</pre>

<H3>4. Setting up HMMER</H3>
For the EMBASSY HMMER package to work, the directory containing the original HMMER executables *must* be in your path. For example if you executables were installed to "/usr/local/hmmer/bin", then type:
<pre>
set path=(/usr/local/hmmer/bin/ $path)
rehash
</pre>

<H3> 5. Getting help </H3>
Please read the Userguide.pdf distributed with the original HMMER and included in the EMBASSY HMMER distribution under the DOCS directory. The first 3 chapters (Introduction, Installation and Tutorial) are particularly useful.
<p>Please read the 'Notes' section below for a description of the differences between the original and EMBASSY HMMER, particularly which application command line options are supported.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->
<H3>Types of input data</H3>
hmmer v3.2.1 and therefore EMBASSY HMMER is only recommended for use with protein sequences.  If you provide a non-protein sequence you will be reprompted for a protein sequence.  To accept nucleic acid sequences you must replace instances of < type: "protein" > in the application ACD files with <type: "nucleic" >.

<H3>Environment variables</H3>
The original hmmer uses BLAST environment variables (below), if defined, to locate files. The EMBASSY HMMER does not.
<pre>
BLASTDB   location of sequence databases to be searched
BLASMAT   location of substitution matrices
HMMERDB   location of HMMs
</pre>

<H3>Disk space requirements</H3>
ehmmpfam makes a temporary local copy of its input sequence data.  You must ensure there is sufficient disk space for this in the directory that ehmmpfam is run.

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program, eg:
        "FATAL xxx" - means you have not set up the xxx data using program <b>prog</b>.<p>

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Sean Eddy
as part of his HMMER package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.
