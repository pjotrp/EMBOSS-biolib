<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies from protein sequences (input using the standard
one-letter code for amino acids) using the parsimony method, in a
variant which counts only those nucleotide changes that change the
amino acid, on the assumption that silent changes are more easily
accomplished.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program infers an unrooted phylogeny from protein sequences,
using a new method intermediate between the approaches of Eck and
Dayhoff (1966) and Fitch (1971). Eck and Dayhoff (1966) allowed any
amino acid to change to any other, and counted the number of such
changes needed to evolve the protein sequences on each given
phylogeny. This has the problem that it allows replacements which are
not consistent with the genetic code, counting them equally with
replacements that are consistent. Fitch, on the other hand, counted
the minimum number of nucleotide substitutions that would be needed to
achieve the given protein sequences. This counts silent changes
equally with those that change the amino acid.

<p>
The present method insists that any changes of amino acid be
consistent with the genetic code so that, for example, lysine is
allowed to change to methionine but not to proline. However, changes
between two amino acids via a third are allowed and counted as two
changes if each of the two replacements is individually allowed. This
sometimes allows changes that at first sight you would think should be
outlawed. Thus we can change from phenylalanine to glutamine via
leucine in two steps total. Consulting the genetic code, you will find
that there is a leucine codon one step away from a phenylalanine
codon, and a leucine codon one step away from glutamine. But they are
not the same leucine codon. It actually takes three base substitutions
to get from either of the phenylalanine codons TTT and TTC to either
of the glutamine codons CAA or CAG. Why then does this program count
only two? The answer is that recent DNA sequence comparisons seem to
show that synonymous changes are considerably faster and easier than
ones that change the amino acid. We are assuming that, in effect,
synonymous changes occur so much more readily that they need not be
counted. Thus, in the chain of changes TTT (Phe) --> CTT (Leu) --> CTA
(Leu) --> CAA (Glu), the middle one is not counted because it does not
change the amino acid (leucine).

<p>
To maintain consistency with the genetic code, it is necessary for the
program internally to treat serine as two separate states (ser1 and
ser2) since the two groups of serine codons are not adjacent in the
code. Changes to the state "deletion" are counted as three steps to
prevent the algorithm from assuming unnecessary deletions. The state
"unknown" is simply taken to mean that the amino acid, which has not
been determined, will in each part of a tree that is evaluated be
assumed be whichever one causes the fewest steps.

<p>
The assumptions of this method (which has not been described in the
literature), are thus something like this:


<p>
Change in different sites is independent.  Change in different
lineages is independent.  The probability of a base substitution that
changes the amino acid sequence is small over the lengths of time
involved in a branch of the phylogeny.  The expected amounts of change
in different branches of the phylogeny do not vary by so much that two
changes in a high-rate branch are more probable than one change in a
low-rate branch.  The expected amounts of change do not vary enough
among sites that two changes in one site are more probable than one
change in another.  The probability of a base change that is
synonymous is much higher than the probability of a change that is not
synonymous.  That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has
been documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979,
1981b, 1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony
methods make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the works
by Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b, 1988), but also read the
exchange between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<p>
The input for the program is fairly standard. The first line contains
the number of species and the number of amino acid positions (counting
any stop codons that you want to include).

<p>
Next come the species data. Each sequence starts on a new line, has a
ten-character species name that must be blank-filled to be of that
length, followed immediately by the species data in the one-letter
code. The sequences must either be in the "interleaved" or
"sequential" formats described in the Molecular Sequence Programs
document. The I option selects between them. The sequences can have
internal blanks in the sequence but there must be no extra blanks at
the end of the terminated line. Note that a blank is not a valid
symbol for a deletion.

<p>
The protein sequences are given by the one-letter code used by
described in the Molecular Sequence Programs documentation file. Note
that if two polypeptide chains are being used that are of different
length owing to one terminating before the other, they should be coded
as (say)

<p>
<pre>
             HIINMA*????
             HIPNMGVWABT
</pre>

<p>
since after the stop codon we do not definitely know that there has
been a deletion, and do not know what amino acid would have been
there. If DNA studies tell us that there is DNA sequence in that
region, then we could use "X" rather than "?". Note that "X" means an
unknown amino acid, but definitely an amino acid, while "?" could mean
either that or a deletion. The distinction is often significant in
regions where there are deletions: one may want to encode a six-base
deletion as "-?????" since that way the program will only count one
deletion, not six deletion events, when the deletion arises. However,
if there are overlapping deletions it may not be so easy to know what
coding is correct.

<p>
One will usually want to use "?" after a stop codon, if one does not
know what amino acid is there. If the DNA sequence has been observed
there, one probably ought to resist putting in the amino acids that
this DNA would code for, and one should use "X" instead, because under
the assumptions implicit in this parsimony method, changes to any
noncoding sequence are much easier than changes in a coding region
that change the amino acid, so that they shouldn't be counted anyway!

<p>
The form of this information is the standard one described in the main
documentation file. For the U option the tree provided must be a
rooted bifurcating tree, with the root placed anywhere you want, since
that root placement does not affect anything.

   -->

<b>fprotpars</b> output is standard: if option 1 is toggled on, the
data is printed out, with the convention that "." means "the same as
in the first species". Then comes a list of equally parsimonious
trees, and (if option 2 is toggled on) a table of the number of
changes of state required in each position. If option 5 is toggled on,
a table is printed out after each tree, showing for each branch
whether there are known to be changes in the branch, and what the
states are inferred to have been at the top end of the branch. This is
a reconstruction of the ancestral sequences in the tree. If you choose
option 5, a menu item "." appears which gives you the opportunity to
turn off dot-differencing so that complete ancestral sequences are
shown. If the inferred state is a "?" there will be multiple
equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must work these
out for themselves by hand. If option 6 is left in its default state
the trees found will be written to a tree file, so that they are
available to be used in other programs. If the program finds multiple
trees tied for best, all of these are written out onto the output tree
file. Each is followed by a numerical weight in square brackets (such
as [0.25000]). This is needed when we use the trees to make a
consensus tree of the results of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to
avoid overrepresenting replicates that find many tied trees.

If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the best tree. This test, which is a version of
the test proposed by Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test
case by me (1985a). It is closely parallel to a test using log
likelihood differences due to Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and uses
the mean and variance of step differences between trees, taken across
positions. If the mean is more than 1.96 standard deviations different
then the trees are declared significantly different. The program
prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences of each
from the best one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the
step differences at individual positions, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.
