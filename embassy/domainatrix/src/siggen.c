**
**  
**  Summary
**  Generates a sparse protein signature from an alignment and residue contact 
**  data.
**
**
**  
**  Input and Output
**  siggen reads a directory of scop family alignments file and, optionally, a
**  directory containing a contacts file for each domain in an alignment, and
**  generates a protein signature of a specified sparsity for each alignment.
**  The scop Sunid (an integer) of a family will be used as the base name for
**  its signature file. The paths and extensions for the alignment (input) and
**  signature (output) files are provided by the user. 
**
**
** 
**  Sister applications
**  A 'scop family alignment file' contains a sequence alignment of domains 
**  belonging to the same scop family.  The file is in embl-like format and is
**  annotated with records describing the SCOP classification of the family.  A
**  scop family alignment file generatd by scopalign will contain a structure-
**  based sequence alignment of domains of known structure only.  Such 
**  alignments can be extended with sequence relatives (of unknown structure)
**  to the family in question by using seqalign.
**  A 'contacts file' contains intra-chain residue-residue contact data for a
**  protein or domain.  The files are generated by contacts and are in embl-
**  like format.
**  A signature file is used by sigscan. 
**
**
**
**  Notes
**  In the case a signature file is generated by hand, it is essential that the 
**  gap data given is listed in order of increasing gap size.  
**
**  The user is prompted for a window size that is used for every position in 
**  the signature.  Likely this is not optimal.
**  A future implementation will provide a range of methods for generating 
**  values of window size depending upon the alignment (window size is 
**  identified by the WSIZ record in the signature output file).
**  
**  There are 3 modes for signatures generatation: (1) Use positions specified
**  in alignment file. The alignment file must contain a line beginning with 
**  the text 'Positions' for each line of the alignment.  A '1' in the 
**  'Positions' line indicates that the signature should include data from the
**  corresponding alignment site.  The signature will only include the 
**  positions that are marked with a '1'.  (2) Use a scoring method.  The 
**  alignment is scored (see 'Algorithm') and the signature of a specified 
**  sparsity is sampled from high scoring positions.  (3): Generate a 
**  randomised signature.  A signature of a specified sparsity is sampled at
**  random from the alignment.
**  
** 
**  
**  Known bugs & warnings
**  Handling of missing residues in scop alignment files
**  The alignment in the scop alignment file is generated by using stamp. 
**  stamp will omit from an alignment any residues that either completely lacks
**  electron density and so does not appear in the ATOM records of the pdb 
**  file, or which lacks a CA atom.  Such residues will of course not be 
**  present in the scop alignment file.  This means that acurate gap distances
**  (distance, in residues, between any two residues) for residues from two 
**  different alignment positions cannot reliably be found by simply counting
**  residues.  
** 
**  To overcome this problem, data from the clean domain coordinate files are
**  used.  These data should be used where available, i.e. the conoption acd
**  option should be set to a value 1, 2, 3 or 4 if possible.
**  
**  The function ajXyzPdbAtomIndexICA is used to create an array which gives 
**  the index into the full-length protein sequence for structured residues,
**  i.e. residues for which electron density was determined, EXCLUDING those
**  residues for which CA atoms are missing. The array length is of course 
**  equal to the number of structured residues.  This array is used for 
**  calculating the correct gap distances between residues in the alignment.
**  The clean domain coordinate files MUST be derived from clean protein 
**  coordinate files in which residues with a single atom only are ommitted.
**  Such files ccan be generated by pdbparse with the atommask option set to
**  True.  This requirement will not be necessary when a new version of 
**  ajXyzPdbAtomIndexICA which also excludes residues with a single atom only
**  becomes available.
**  
**  
**  
**  Description
**  This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or 
**  indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.  
**  This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
**  accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
**  be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
**  and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described 
**  pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
**  whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**  
**  Protein signatures are useful for characterising protein families and 
**  have been generated manually in the past (Ison et al, 2000).  siggen 
**  provides various methods to generate automatically protein signatures. 
**  
** 
**   
**  Algorithm
**  signature generation, proceeds in three stages as follows: (i) Read data 
**  and write residue-residue contact maps.  (ii) Apply selected scoring 
**  methods to potential signature positions.  (iii) Select residues to form
**  the signature and write residue identity and residue gap data into 
**  signature output file.
**  
**  Data Parsing
**  siggen reads scop alignment files and, optionally, clean domain coordinate
**  files and contact files corresponding to domains in the alignment.  A 
**  contact map for each protein domain in the structural alignment is used.
**  A contact map is an N by N matrix (where N is the length of the sequence),
**  a '1' at any element of the matrix indicates contact between the two 
**  residues at the corresponding positions, a '0' indicates no contact (see 
**  contacts.c for more information).  The data from the scop alignment files
**  are parsed, including the Post_Similar line, which is fundamental to the 
**  algorithm; the user specifies whether only alignment positions with a 
**  post_similar value of '1' are considered to be potential signature 
**  positions or whether all positions are considered as potential candidates.
**  Alignment positions where the Post_Similar value is represented by a '-' 
**  are not considered because one or more of the proteins in the alignment
**  were assigned a gap by the stamp program that was used to generate the 
**  alignment given in the scop alignment file (see  scopalign.c).
**  
**  Residue Scoring Schemes
**  The algorithm provides four scoring schemes that can be applied to aligned
**  positions (i.e. positions with Post_Similar values that is not '-' or, 
**  optionally, '0' either), to enable key residues to be selected for the 
**  final signature.  The schemes can be split into two groups: sequence based,
**  and structure based.  Each position in the alignment is scored on the basis
**  of a single or combination of 2 scoring schemes, one each from the different
**  groups, thus providing a method of refining/improving the generation
**  of signatures.  Every aligned position is allocated a normalised score 
**  based on one or more of the following schemes.
**  
**  Sequence Based Scoring - Residue Identity (ResId)
**  This scoring function simply takes every residue at a particular aligned
**  position, and calculates a score for the substitution of each residue pair,
**  using a residue substitution matrix.  The average residue substitution 
**  score for the position is then normalised and the score assigned to the 
**  score array for that alignment position.
**  
**  Sequence Based Scoring - Residue Variability (ResVar)
**  This scoring scheme implements the residue variability function of (Mirny
**  & Shakhnovich, 2001).
**
**  s(l) = - sum for i=1 to i=6 ( pi(l) x log pi(l) )
**  
**  Where s(l) is the variability at position l, and pi(l) is the frequency of
**  residues from class i at position l.  Six classes of residue are defined 
**  which reflect their physical-chemical properties and natural pattern of 
**  substitution as follows: (i) Aliphatic	(A, V, L, I, M, C); (ii) 
**  Aromatic (F, W, Y, H); (iii) Polar (S, T, N, Q); (iv) Basic (K, R); (v) 
**  Acidic (D, E); (vi) Special (G, P).  The special class represents the 
**  special conformational properties of glycine and proline.  As a result of
**  this classification mutations within a class are ignored  e.g. L to V, 
**  whereas mutations that change the residue class are taken into account.  
**  Thus each aligned position is given a normalised score that reflects the 
**  variability of all the residues in that particular position.
**  
**  Structure Based Scoring - Number of Residue-Residue Contacts (N-Con)
**  The contact scoring scheme provides a score based purely on structural 
**  information, i.e. the identity and nature of the residues are not 
**  considered.  The structural information used is the number of 
**  residue-residue contacts and the contact maps generated in the first phase
**  of the algorithm are used to derive the number of contacts made by residues
**  at aligned positions.  Each residue from an aligned position is noted, and
**  the position that residue occupies in its original protein sequence is 
**  determined.  The column of the contact map that corresponds to the position
**  of the residue in its original sequence is identified, the occurrence of a
**  '1' anywhere in that column of the matrix is recorded, and the total number
**  of '1's indicates the total number of contacts that residue makes. The 
**  number of contacts for each residue at a particular aligned position are 
**  determined, the average number of contacts is calculated and the resulting
**  value normalised.  This procedure is then repeated for every aligned position.
**  
**  Structure Based Scoring - Conservation of Residue Contacts (C-Con)
**  This scoring scheme extends the concept of the number of contacts residues
**  at aligned positions make, by also determining which residues are contacted
**  and their position in the alignment, thus providing a score representing
**  how conserved the contacts made by residues at an aligned position are.  
**  The initial stage of the process is identical to that for determining the
**  number of contacts, except every time a contact is found in the contact map,
**  the position of the contacted residue is recorded and its position in the 
**  alignment determined.  Each residue in an aligned position therefore has 
**  associated with it a list of positions in the alignment with which it makes
**  contact.  For example if all the residues at position 25 of the alignment
**  make contact with the residues at position 79 of the alignment, a conserved
**  contact is defined and a maximum score is allocated to the residues at 
**  position 25.  This procedure is repeated for all the contacts made by the 
**  residues at position 25 and an average normalised conservation of contact
**  score calculated.
**  
**  Selection of Signature Positions
**  The final phase of the algorithm involves selecting the residues that will 
**  make up the signature.  Following the scoring phase siggen will have 
**  created an array of scores for each scoring scheme employed, i.e. a score
**  will have been allocated for every position in the alignment with a 
**  Post_Similar value of '1' and optionally '0' also (depending on the 
**  Post_Similar option selected, see below).  If more than one scoring scheme
**  was used then the scores for each alignment position from the different 
**  scoring methods are added together, to give a final array (total score 
**  array) of the total scores for each position.  It is these final scores 
**  that determine which positions will make up the signature.
** 
**  Signature Sparsity
**  The signature sparsity is a user-defined parameter that determines how many
**  residues the final signature will contain, for example, if the average 
**  sequence length of the proteins in the alignment is 250 residues, then a 
**  signature of sparsity 10% (default value) will contain 25 key residues or
**  signature positions, that correspond to the top 25% highest scoring 
**  alignment positions.
**
**  
**  Key Residue Selection
**  Assuming that a signature of 10% sparsity is desired and the average 
**  sequence length of the proteins is 250 residues, the total score array is 
**  re-arranged into ascending order of score.  The top (highest scoring) 25 
**  alignment positions (equal to 10% sparsity) are then selected, it is these
**  25 positions which will make up the final signature.  These 25 highest 
**  scoring alignment positions are then traced back to the original protein 
**  sequences, the residue identities determined and gap data (number of 
**  residues between signature positions) calculated.  The signature output 
**  file is then written, this specifies for each of the 25 signature positions
**  the residues that are observed at that position in the alignment, and the 
**  gap (in residues) between that position and the next.  In the case of the
**  first signature position the gap data corresponds to the number of residues
**  between the beginning of the sequence and the first position.
**  
**  Signature Generating Parameters
**  The SigGen algorithm incorporates several options that can be selected when
**  generating a signature.  The first is the signature sparsity, which has 
**  been introduced above and affects the amount of information encoded in the
**  signature.  In addition to the four scoring schemes described above, there
**  are two further option to be considered when generating a signature.
**  
**  Post_Similar Option
**  This option determines which alignment positions should be considered as 
**  putative signature positions.  As mentioned above, the Post_Similar line 
**  represents aligned positions by either a '1' a '0' or a '-'.  SigGen gives
**  the option of considering both positions with values of '1' and '0' or 
**  ignoring positions represented by '0', which STAMP considers to be less 
**  structurally equivalent, and therefore use just positions with a 
**  Post_Similar value of  '1'.
**  
**  Contact Filtering Option
**  This option also determines which aligned positions should be considered 
**  as putative key residues for inclusion in the signature.  However, the 
**  criterion in this case is whether or not the average number of contacts
**  that the residues at that position make is above a defined threshold (the
**  contact threshold).  The default value is 10 contacts, i.e. only aligned 
**  positions that make on average 10 or more residue-residue contacts will be
**  considered as potential key residues.  As with all the SigGen parameters, 
**  they can be used in combination.  For example, selecting the following 
**  parameters: contact threshold = 10; residue identity and conservation of
**  contact scoring schemes; Post_Similar option set to ignore positions with
**  values of '0'; signature sparsity set to 15%, the SigGen algorithm would
**  proceed in the following manner: (i) Determine positions with Post_Similar
**  value of '1'; (ii) Determine which of those positions make greater than 10
**  residue contacts; (iii) Apply the residue id and conservation of contact 
**  scoring schemes to the positions resulting from the previous two filtering
**  steps;  (iv) Select the top scoring 15% positions to make up the signature.
**  (v) Write signature file.
**  
**  
**  
**  Usage 
**  An example of interactive use of siggen is shown below.
**  
**  Unix % siggen

**           5 : None (no structural data available)
**  Select number [5]: 5
**  Ignore alignment postitions with post_similar value of 0 [Y]: y
**  Location of signature files (output) [./]: /test_data
**  Extension of signature files [.sig]: 
**  Unix % 
**  
**  A sparse protein signature was generated for each scop alignment file with
**  the file extension .salign in the directory /test_data.  The signatures 
**  included high scoring positions from the alignments, scored on the basis 
**  of residue variability calculated by using the EBLOSUM62 residue 
**  substitution matrix (mode 2).  Signatures of 15% sparsity were generated, 
**  and the default window size (0) was used. 
**  Alignment postitions with a post_similar value of 0 were ignored, i.e. not
**  sampled in the signature.  No structural data were available for the 
**  domains in the alignments and this was specified as option 5 in the 
**  "Residue contacts scoring method".  Signature files with the file extenion
**  .sig were written to the directory /test_data.
**  
**  The following command line would achieve the same result.
**  
**  siggen /test_data .salign /test_data .sig 
**  -mode 2 -sparsity 15 -seqoption 1 -datafile EBLOSUM62 -conoption 5 
**  -filterpsim Y -wsiz 0
**
**
**  
**  Input file format
**  The format of the scop alignment file is described in scopalign.c
**  The format of the contact files is described in contacts.c
**  The format of the domain coordinate files is described in pdbparse.c
**  
**  
**  
**  Output file format
**  The output file (below) uses the following records.  The four SCOP 
**  classification records are taken from the alignment input file: 
**  (1)  CL - Domain class.  It is identical to the text given after 'Class' in 
**  the scop classification file (see documentation for the EMBOSS application 
**  scope). 
**  (2)  FO - Domain fold.  It is identical to the text given after 'Fold' in 
**  the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 
**  (3)  SF - Domain superfamily.  It is identical to the text given after 
**  'Superfamily' in the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 
**  (4)  FA - Domain family. It is identical to the text given after 'Family' 
**  in the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 
**  (5)  NP - Number of signature positions.
**  (6)  NN - Signature position number.  The number given in brackets after 
**  this record indicates the start of the data for the relevent signature 
**  position.
**  (7)  IN - Informative line about signature position. The number of different 
**  amino acid residues seen for this position is given after 'NRES', the number 
**  of different sizes of gap follows 'NGAP', and the window size after 'WSIZ'.
**  When a signature is aligned to a protein sequence, the permissible gaps 
**  between two signature positions is determined by the empirical gaps and the 
**  window size for the C-terminal position (see sigscan.c)
**  Two rows of data for the emprical residues and gaps are then given:
**  (8)  AA - The identifier of a residue seen in this position and the 
**  frequency of its occurence are delimited by ';'.
**  (9)  GA - The size of a gap seen in this position and the frequency 
**  of its occurence are delimited by ';'.
**  (10) // - used to delimit data for each signature. The last line of a file 
**  always  contains '//' only.
