**  Application name
**  libscan
**  
**  
**  
**  Summary
**  Scans each signature, profile or HMM in a directory against a sequence 
**  database and writes a signature hits file for each one. Or scans sequences 
**  against such a library of discriminating elements and writes a library scan 
**  file for each one.
** 
**  
**   
**  Input and Output
**  libscan runs in one of two modes either (i) database search mode or (ii) 
**  library screen mode. In database search mode libscan reads one or more
**  directories each containing a single type of discriminating element, the
**  permitted types are sparse sequence signature, Gribskov profile, Henikoff
**  profile or hidden Markov model.  Each directory must contain a 
**  discriminating element for each of one or more scop families; files for
**  indivdual families should have the same name (possibly with different file
**  extensions) in the different directories, e.g. the scop family with the
**  identifier 46445 might be represented by files 46445.hmm, 46445.sig, 
**  46445.gribs and 46445.henik in their respective directories.  libscan scans
**  each discriminating element against a sequence set that must also be 
**  provided by the user and generates a signature hits file (of scored hits 
**  to sequences in the set) for each individual discriminating element.  In 
**  mode (i), the user must also provide a scop validation file so that a 
**  classification of hits can be given in the signature hits files.  The user
**  specifies a maximum number of false hits that are written to the signature
**  hits files.
**  In library screen mode, libscan
**  reads a sequence set, screens each sequence against the library 
**  (directories of discriminating elements) and writes a library scan file
**  (of top-scoring families) for each sequence.  In either mode, a scop 
**  classification file is required as a source of family classification data.
**  The paths and extensions of the sequence set and scop classification files
**  (input) different types of discriminating elements (input), and paths and
**  extension of signature hits files or library scan file (output) are 
**  specified by the user.
** 
**  
**
**  Sister applications
**  Hidden Markov models can be generated for scop families by using hmmgen 
**  which uses the HMMER package.
**  Simple frequency matrices, Gribskov profiles and Hennikoff profiles can be 
**  generated for scop families by using profgen.
**  A 'signature file' contains a sparse sequence signature.  The files are 
**  generated by siggen.
**  A 'signature hits file' contains the results of a search of a 
**  discriminating element (one of protein signature, hidden Markov model, 
**  simple frequency matrix, Gribskov profile or Hennikoff profile) against a 
**  sequence database.  The files are generated by sigscan and modelscan.
**  A 'library scan file' holds the results of a search of a sequence against a
**  library of discriminating elements for scop families (one directory for 
**  each type of element, e.g. sparse sequence signatures, profiles or HMMs). 
**  The library scan file contains, for each invividual type of discriminating
**  element and for the combination of the elements, classification and other 
**  data for each of a user-defined number of top-scoring families 
**  (discriminators) from the scop database.
**  A 'scop classification file' contains classification and other data for 
**  domains from the scop database.  The file is in embl-like format and is 
**  generated by scopparse.  Domain sequence information can be added to the 
**  file by using scopseqs.
**  A 'scop validation file' contains sequence relatives (hits) for each of a
**  number of different scop families, superfamilies and folds.  The file 
**  contains the collated results from psiblast searches of a sequence database
**  for the indvidual scop families; hits of unambiguous family assignment are
**  listed under their respective family, otherwise a hit is assigned as 
**  relatives to a scop superfamily or fold instead.  The scop validation file
**  is generated by seqnr and is in embl-like format.
**  
**  
**  
**  Notes
**  
**  
**  
**  Known bugs & warnings
**  The score distributions and therefore p-values are calculated only from the
**  data that libscan is provided.  Therefore, meaningful p-values are only 
**  guaranteed if the sequence set (database search mode) or number of families 
**  (library screeen mode) is sufficiently large.
**  
**  
**  
**  Description
**  This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or 
**  indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.  
**  This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
**  accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
**  be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
**  and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described 
**  pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
**  whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**  
**  The advantage of screening a relatively small library of discriminating 
**  elements with a sequence is that it is sufficient for the sequence to 
**  detect its true family (discriminator) in the first rank for an effective
**  prediction.  This is in contrast to searching a larger sequence database to
**  identify homology, where biologically significant hits may achieve 
**  statistically insignificant scores and therefore be missed.  A library 
**  might help the detection of such proteins because they may still score 
**  their true discriminator higher than the others in the library regardless
**  of statistical estimates.  Further improvements to predictions are gained
**  when multiple sources of evidence, in this case the different types of
**  discriminating element, are considered.  
**  The libscan application allows a protein sequence or sequences to be 
**  screened against the library of discriminating elements.  The results of a
**  screen are returned to the user in a library scan file containing a list 
**  of top-scoring SCOP domains rank-ordered by p-value for each individual 
**  type of discriminator, and also for all of the discriminator types in 
**  combination (combined prediction).  For the combined prediction, the 
**  p-value is derived from an empirically derived distribution of the product
**  of the p-values of the individual methods.  
**  
**  
**  
**  Algorithm
**  The approach for calculating p-values for individual discriminator-sequence
**  matches is the same irrespective of which mode libscan is run in and is
**  summarised as follows: (i) Each discriminating element is scanned (scored)
**  against each sequence.  (ii) The ditribution of scores is generated for 
**  each different type of element.  (iii) Using these distributions, a p-value
**  is calculated for each discriminator-sequence match.  
**  The approach for calculating the 'combined p-value' for each individual 
**  sequence is as follows: (i) p-values of the matches for the different types
**  of discriminator versus a sequence are multiplied to yield the 'product of
**  p-values'.  (ii) A distribution of 'product of p-values' is generated for
**  each individual sequence.  (iii) Using these distributions, a so-called 
**  'combined p-value', reflecting the overall significance of the matches of
**  the sequence to the different types of discriminators, is generated. 
**  Importantly, two (or more) p-values are only ever multiplied together if 
**  corresponding hit is to the same region of the protein.  'Same' is defined
**  as two hits overlapping by a user-defined number of residues.

**  libscan was run in library screen mode and screened each sequence in the 
**  sequence database /libscan/MHC_Ig.seqs against a library of models 
**  comprising sparse sequence signatures, Gribskov profiles, Henikoff 
**  profiles and hidden Markov model.  The appropriate files were kept in the
**  directories /libscan/sig, /libscan/grib, /libscan/henik and /libscan/hmm 
**  and had the file extensions .sig, .gribs, .henik and .hmm respectively.
**  The library scan files were written to the directories /libscan/sigout, 
**  /libscan/gribout, /libscan/henikout and /libscan/hmmout and had the file
**  extensions .sigout, .gribout, .henikout and .hmmout respectively.  The 
**  gap insertion and extension penalties for matches of Gribskov profiles 
**  to sequences were both 1.0.   The gap insertion and extension penalties
**  for matches of sparse sequence signatures to sequences were 10.0 and 0.5 
**  respectively, the EBLOSUM62 residue substitution matrix was used.  The 
**  N-terminal matching option was set to 1 meaning that the N-terminal 
**  signature position could be aligned anywhere without penalty and that 
**  only complete signature-sequence fits are allowed.  SCOP family 
**  classification data were taken from the SCOP classification file 
**  /libscan/scop_classification.  Library scan files representing the merged
**  results of the different types of discriminating elements were written to
**  the directory /libscan/mrgout and had the file extension .mrgout.
