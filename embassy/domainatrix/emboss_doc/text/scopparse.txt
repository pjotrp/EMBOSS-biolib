1.0 SUMMARY

   Generate DCF file from raw SCOP files

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SCOPPARSE parses the dir.cla.scop.txt and dir.des.scop.txt SCOP
   classification files, e.g. available at URLs:
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.cla.scop.txt_1.57
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.des.scop.txt_1.57
   The format of these files is explained at URL:
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/release-notes-1.55.html
   SCOPPARSE writes the classification to a DCF file (EMBL-like format).
   No changes are made to the data other than changing the format in
   which it is held. The file does not include domain sequence
   information. The input and output files are specified by the user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   An excerpt from the dir.cla.scop.txt (Figure 1) and dir.des.scop.txt
   (Figure 2) SCOP input files is shown below. The format of these files
   is explained on the SCOP website:
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.cla.scop.txt_1.57

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   An example of the DCF output file is shown in Figure 3. The records
   used to describe an entry are as follows. Records (4) to (9) are used
   to describe the position of the domain in the SCOP hierarchy. Various
   other ADDITIONAL RECORDS may be present if the file is processed by
   other programs, e.g. DOMAINSEQS or DOMAINSSE.
     * (1) ID - Domain identifier code. This is a 7-character code that
       uniquely identifies the domain in SCOP. It is identical to the
       first 7 characters of a line in the SCOP classification file. The
       first character is always 'D', the next four characters are the
       PDB identifier code, the fifth character is the PDB chain
       identifier to which the domain belongs (a '.' is given in cases
       where the domain is composed of multiple chains, a '_' is given
       where a chain identifier was not specified in the PDB file) and
       the final character is the number of the domain in the chain (for
       chains comprising more than one domain) or '_' (the chain
       comprises a single domain only).
     * (2) EN - PDB identifier code. This is the 4-character PDB
       identifier code of the PDB entry containing the domain.
     * (3) TY - domain type. "CATH" or "SCOP" is given ("SCOP" for DCF
       files generated by using SCOPPARSE).
     * (4) SI - SCOP Sunid's. The integers preceeding the codes CL, FO,
       SF, FA, DO, SO and DD are the SCOP sunids for Class, Fold,
       Superfamily, Family, Domain, Source and domain data respectively.
       These numbers uniquely identify the appropriate node in the SCOP
       parsable files.
     * (5) CL - Domain class. It is identical to the text given after
       'Class' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (6) FO - Domain fold. It is identical to the text given after
       'Fold' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (7) SF - Domain superfamily. It is identical to the text given
       after 'Superfamily' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (8) FA - Domain family. It is identical to the text given after
       'Family' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (9) DO - Domain name. It is identical to the text given after
       'Protein' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (10) OS - Source of the protein. It is identical to the text given
       after 'Species' in the SCOP classification file.
     * (11) DS - Sequence of the domain according to the PDB file. This
       sequence is taken from the domain clean coordinate file generated
       by DOMAINER. The DS record will only be present if the DCF file
       has been processed using DOMAINSEQS.
     * (12) NC - Number of chains comprising the domain, or number of
       segments from the same chain that the domain is comprised of. NC
       is usually 1. If the number of chains is greater than 1, then the
       domain entry will have a section containing a CN and a CH record
       (see below) for each chain.
     * (13) CN - Chain number. The number given in brackets after this
       record indicates the start of the data for the relevent chain.
     * (14) CH - Domain definition. The character given before CHAIN is
       the PDB chain identifier (a '.' is given in cases where a chain
       identifier was not specified in the DCF file), the strings before
       START and END give the start and end positions respectively of the
       domain in the PDB file (a '.' is given in cases where a position
       was not specified). Note that the start and end positions refer to
       residue numbering given in the original PDB file and therefore
       must be treated as strings.
     * (15) XX - used for spacing.
     * (16) // - used to delimit records for a domain.

  [-desinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of raw SCOP
                                  description file dir.des.scop.txt_X.XX
                                  (input). This is the raw SCOP description
                                  file available at
                                  http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.
des.scop.txt_1.57.
   -nosegments         boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains comprising of more than one segment.
                                  This is necessary if a continuous residue
                                  sequence is required.
   -nomultichain       boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains comprising segments from more than
                                  one chain. This is necessary if a continuous
                                  residue sequence is required.
  [-dcffile]           outfile    [test.scop] This option specifies the name
                                  of SCOP DCF file (domain classification
                                  file) (output). A 'domain classification
                                  file' contains classification and other data
                                  for domains from the SCOP or CATH
                                  databases. The file is generated by using
                                  DOMAINER and is in DCF format (EMBL-like).
                                  Domain sequence information can be added to
                                  the file by using DOMAINSEQS.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -nominor            boolean    [N] This option specifies whether to omit
                                  domains from minor classes (defined as
                                  anything not in class 'All alpha proteins',
                                  'All beta proteins', 'Alpha and beta

                                  (a+b)'). This is necessary or appropriate
                                  for many analyses.
