<tr>
<td>[-dcfinfile]<br>(Parameter 1)</td>
<td>This option specifies name of DCF file (domain classification file) (input). A 'domain classification file' contains classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by using DOMAINSEQS.</td>

<tr>
<td>-retain</td>
<td>This option specifies whether to write redundant domains to a separate file. If this option is selected, redundant domains are written to a separate output file.</td>
<td>Toggle value Yes/No</td>

<tr>
<td>-node</td>
<td>This option specifies the node for redundancy removal. Redundancy can be removed at any specified node in the SCOP or CATH hierarchies. For example by selecting 'Class' entries belonging to the same Class will be non-redundant.</td>

<tr>
<td>-mode</td>
<td>This option specifies whether to remove redundancy at a single threshold % sequence similarity or remove redundancy outside a range of acceptable threshold % similarity. All permutations of pair-wise sequence alignments are calculated for each domain family in turn using the EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm. Redundant sequences are removed in one of two modes as follows: (i) If a pair of proteins achieve greater than a threshold percentage sequence similarity (specified by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of proteins have a percentage sequence similarity that lies outside an acceptable range (specified by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded.</td>

<tr>
<td>-gapopen</td>
<td>This option specifies the gap insertion penalty. This is the score taken away when a gap is created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.</td>
<td>Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0</td>
<td>10.0 for any sequence</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-gapextend</td>
<td>This option specifies the gap extension penalty. This is added to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty.</td>
