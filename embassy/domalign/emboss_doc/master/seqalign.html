<!-- SUMMARY
     Succint description of the application, particularly its inputs, outputs
     and what it does.  The same text is given at the top of the source (.c)
     file and in the <documentation> attribute of the <application definition>
     of the ACD file.

     modes of usage (if appropriate). More detail than the summary.

SEQALIGN reads a directory of "seed" alignments and a directory of sets of protein sequences and writes a directory of "extended" alignments.  An extended alignment is a seed alignment that is extended with sequences from the appropriate sequence set.  The sets directory must contain a sequence set for each seed alignment directory and the files must have the same base name.  For example, sequences from "family.sets" are used to extend the seed alignment "family.aln". 
<br>Typically, the inputs are (i) DAF files (domain alignment files) containing structure-based sequence alignments and (ii) DHF files (domain hits files) containing sequence relatives (of unknown structure) of these alignments, and the output are DAF files containing the extended alignments. 
<br>The base names of the output alignments are the same as the input alignments.  The paths for input and output files are specified by the user and the file extensions are set in the ACD file.




<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing 

     Use "<b>SEQALIGN</b> reads any normal sequence USAs." if
     appropriate.

The format of the domain alignment file is described in <a href="domainalign.html">DOMAINALIGN documentation</a>. 
<br>If other alignment files are used as input, all of the common file formats are supported.

<!-- OUTPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of output file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.  
     If the standard description of the avalable report formats is required, 
     use:   #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
     Use "Outputs a graph to the specified graphics device."
     or  "outputs a report format file. The default format is ..."
     if appropriate.

<a name="4.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 4.0   OUTPUT FILE FORMAT         </H2>
The format of the domain alignment file is described in <a href="domainalign.html">DOMAINALIGN documentation</a>. 

Note however that the file will never contain 'Number' or 'Post_similar' records. Futhermore, the code before each sequence is of the form <b>Acc_Start_End </b>(where domain hits files were used as input sequences) or <b>Acc_n</b> (where other sequences were used as input), where 'Acc' is the accession number of the sequence, 'Start' and 'End' are the start and end point of the sequence in the full length sequence respectively, and 'n' is a sequential count of the sequence in the alignment.

<!-- DATA FILES         
     Any data files used (e.g. translation table file, substitution matrix 
     etc.  This includes example data file formats if they are not obvious.

     be used to inspect and retrieve them, use:

An example of interactive use of SEQALIGN is shown below.

<!--#include file="inc/seqalign.usage" -->

<!-- SEQALIGN read all domain alignment files with the file extension .salign (specified in ACD) from the directory /test_data, and extended these alignments using the sequences from domain hits files with file extension .hits (specified in ACD) in the directory /test_data. Extended domain alignment files (file extension .ealign specified in ACD) were written to /test_data/seqalign. -->


<!-- KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS
     Bugs that have not yet been fixed, easily missued features, problems

<!-- DESCRIPTION
     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>
The generation of sequence alignments for large datasets such as SCOP or CATH
potentially requires a lot of time for preparation of datasets, running 
jobs and so on, in addition to the compute time required for the 
alignments themselves. 
SEQALIGN will generate an extended alignment for each seed alignment in a directory for which a file of sequences is available, by using CLUSTALW.  
Sequences are added one by one to the appropriate seed alignment.




<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.

<a name="10.0"></a>

<!-- RELATED APPLICATIONS
     Other applications that either generate the input, use the output or 
     are in some other way related to the application are described here.

<!-- DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES
     Description of error messages or log file, if one is written.
-->
<a name="12.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 12.0  DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES </H2>
The log file might contain the following messages:
<br><br><i>Could not open seed sequence file my.file </i> (file read error on input sequence alignment or sequence file)
<br><i>Empty alignment in my.file </i> (input alignment was empty.)
<br><i>Empty singlet sequence for my.file </i> (singlet sequence file was empty.)
<br><i>Could not open domain hits file my.file</i>  (file read error on input sequence file.)
<br><i>Not enough sequences found in domain hits file </i> (insufficient sequences (i.e. < 2) in input sequence file.)
