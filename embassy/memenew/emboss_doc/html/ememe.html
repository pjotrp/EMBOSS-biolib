EMBASSY MEME is a suite of application wrappers to the original meme v3.0.14 applications written by  Timothy Bailey. meme v3.0.14 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the meme executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY MEME to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>ememe [options] dataset outfile

<p>The <outfile> parameter is new to EMBASSY MEME. The output is always written to <outfile>. The name of the input sequences may be specified with the -dataset option as normal.

<p>  MEME -- Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation
   
<p>  MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in a group of related DNA or protein
  sequences.
   
<p>  A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related
  protein or DNA sequences. MEME represents motifs as position-dependent
  letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each possible
  letter at each position in the pattern. Individual MEME motifs do not 
  contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps are split by MEME into two 
  or more separate motifs.
   
<p>  MEME takes as input a group of DNA or protein sequences (the training set)
  and outputs as many motifs as requested. MEME uses statistical modeling
  techniques to automatically choose the best width, number of occurrences,
  and description for each motif.
   
<p>  MEME outputs its results as a hypertext (HTML) document.

<h3>  REQUIRED ARGUMENTS:</h3>
<b>  	< dataset ><b>
<br>       The name of the file containing the training set 
  			sequences.  If < dataset > is the word "stdin", MEME
  			reads from standard input.  
  
<p>  			The sequences in the dataset should be in 
  			Pearson/FASTA format.  For example:
<pre>  
  			>ICYA_MANSE INSECTICYANIN A FORM (BLUE BILIPROTEIN)
  			GDIFYPGYCPDVKPVNDFDLSAFAGAWHEIAK
  			LPLENENQGKCTIAEYKYDGKKASVYNSFVSNGVKEYMEGDLEIAPDA
  			>LACB_BOVIN BETA-LACTOGLOBULIN PRECURSOR (BETA-LG) 
  			MKCLLLALALTCGAQALIVTQTMKGLDI
  			QKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKW
</pre>  				
  			Sequences start with a header line followed by
  			sequence lines.  A header line has
  			the character ">" in position one, followed by
  			an unique name without any spaces, followed by
  			(optional) descriptive text.  After the header line 
  			come the actual sequence lines.  Spaces and blank 
  			lines are ignored.  Sequences may be in capital or 
  			lowercase or both.  
  
<p>  			MEME uses the first word in the header line of each 
  			sequence, truncated to 24 characters if necessary,
  			as the name of the sequence. This name must be unique. 
  			Sequences with duplicate names will be ignored. 
  			(The first word in the title line is 
  			everything following the ">" up to the first blank.)
  
<p>  			Sequence weights may be specified in the dataset
  			file by special header lines where the unique name
  			is "WEIGHTS" (all caps) and the descriptive 
  			text is a list of sequence weights. 
  			Sequence weights are numbers in the range 0 < w <=1.
  			All weights are assigned in order to the
  			sequences in the file. If there are more sequences
  			than weights, the remainder are given weight one.
  			Weights must be greater than zero and less than
  			or equal to one.  Weights may be specified by
  			more than one "WEIGHT" entry which may appear
  			anywhere in the file.  When weights are used, 
  			sequences will contribute to motifs in proportion
  			to their weights.  Here is an example for a file
  			of three sequences where the first two sequences are 
  			very similar and it is desired to down-weight them:
<pre>  
  			>WEIGHTS 0.5 .5 1.0 
  			>seq1
  			GDIFYPGYCPDVKPVNDFDLSAFAGAWHEIAK
  			>seq2
  			GDMFCPGYCPDVKPVGDFDLSAFAGAWHELAK
  			>seq3
  			QKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKW
</pre>  

<h3>  OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS:</h3>
   
  MEME has a large number of optional inputs that can be used
  to fine-tune its behavior.  To make these easier to understand
  they are divided into the following categories:
   
<p><b>  		ALPHABET</b>	- control the alphabet for the motifs
  				  (patterns) that MEME will search for
   
<p><b>  		DISTRIBUTION</b>	- control how MEME assumes the occurrences
  				  of the motifs are distributed throughout
  				  the training set sequences
   
<p><b>  		SEARCH</b>		- control how MEME searches for motifs
   
<p><b>                  SYSTEM</b>          - the -p <np> argument causes a version of MEME
                                    compiled for a parallel CPU architecture
                                    to be run.  (By placing < np > in quotes you
                                    may pass installation specific switches to
  				  the 'mpirun' command.  The number of 
                                    processors to run on must be the first 
  				  argument following -p).
  
<p>   
  In what follows, < n > is an integer, < a > is a decimal number, and < string > 
  is a string of characters.
   
<h3>  ALPHABET</h3>

  MEME accepts either DNA or protein sequences, but not both in the same run.
  By default, sequences are assumed to be protein.  The sequences must be in 
  FASTA format.
  
<p>  DNA sequences must contain only the letters "ACGT", plus the ambiguous
  letters "BDHKMNRSUVWY*-". 
<p>  Protein sequences must contain only the letters "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY",
  plus the ambiguous letters "BUXZ*-".
  
<p>  MEME converts all ambiguous letters to "X", which is treated as "unknown".
   
<p><b>  	-dna</b>		Assume sequences are DNA; default: protein sequences
<p><b>  	-protein</b>	Assume sequences are protein
  
   
<h3>  DISTRIBUTION</h3>

  If you know how occurrences of motifs are distributed in the training set 
  sequences, you can specify it with the following optional switches.  The 
  default distribution of motif occurrences is assumed to be zero or one 
  occurrence of per sequence.
   
<p><b>  	-mod < string > </b>   The type of distribution to assume.
<p>  			oops<br>    One Occurrence Per Sequence
<br>  				MEME assumes that each sequence in the dataset
  				contains exactly one occurrence of each motif.
  				This option is the fastest and most sensitive
  				but the motifs returned by MEME may be 
  				"blurry" if any of the sequences is missing
  				them. 	
   
<p>  			zoops<br> Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence
<br>  				MEME assumes that each sequence may contain at
  				most one occurrence of each motif. This option
  				is useful when you suspect that some motifs
  				may be missing from some of the sequences. In
  				that case, the motifs found will be more
  				accurate than using the first option. This
  				option takes more computer time than the
  				first option (about twice as much) and is
  				slightly less sensitive to weak motifs present
  				in all of the sequences.
   
<p>  			anr<br> 	Any Number of Repetitions
<br>  				MEME assumes each sequence may contain any
  				number of non-overlapping occurrences of each
  				motif. This option is useful when you suspect
  				that motifs repeat multiple times within a
  				single sequence. In that case, the motifs 
  				found will be much more accurate than using 
  				one of the other options. This option can also
  				be used to discover repeats within a single
  				sequence. This option takes the much more
  				computer time than the first option (about ten
  				times as much) and is somewhat less sensitive
  				to weak motifs which do not repeat within a
  				single sequence than the other two options.
   
   
<h3>  SEARCH</h3>
  ------
  
<b>  A) OBJECTIVE FUNCTION </b>
  
<p>  MEME uses an objective function on motifs to select the "best" motif.
  The objective function is based on the statistical significance of the 
  log likelihood ratio (LLR) of the occurrences of the motif.  
  The E-value of the motif is an estimate of the number of motifs (with the 
  same width and number of occurrences) that would have equal or higher log 
  likelihood ratio if the training set sequences had been generated randomly 
  according to the (0-order portion of the) background model. 
  
<p>  MEME searches for the motif with the smallest E-value.
  It searches over different motif widths, numbers of occurrences, and
  positions in the training set for the motif occurrences.
  The user may limit the range of motif widths and number of occurrences
  that MEME tries using the switches described below.  In addition,
  MEME trims the motif (using a dynamic programming multiple alignment) to 
  eliminate any positions where there is a gap in any of the occurrences.  
  
<p>  The log likelihood ratio of a motif is
<pre>
  	llr = log (Pr(sites | motif) / Pr(sites | back))
</pre>
  and is a measure of how different the sites are from the background model.
  Pr(sites | motif) is the probability of the occurrences given the a model
  consisting of the position-specific probability matrix (PSPM) of the motif.
  (The PSPM is output by MEME).
<p>  Pr(sites | back) is the  probability of the occurrences given the background
  model.  The background model is an n-order Markov model.  By default,
  it is a 0-order model consisting of the frequencies of the letters in
  the training set.  A different 0-order Markov model or higher order Markov 
  models can be specified to MEME using the -bfile option described below.
  
<p>  The E-value reported by MEME is actually an approximation of the E-value
  of the log likelihood ratio.  (An approximation is used because it is far
  more efficient to compute.)  The approximation is based on the fact that
  the log likelihood ratio of a motif is the sum of the log 
  likelihood ratios of each column of the motif.  Instead of computing the 
  statistical significance of this sum (its p-value), MEME computes the 
  p-value of each column and then computes the significance of their product.  
  Although not identical to the significance of the log likelihood ratio, this 
  easier to compute objective function works very similarly in practice.
  
<p>  The motif significance is reported as the E-value of the motif.  
<p>  The statistical signficance of a motif is computed based on:
<ol>
<li>  	 the log likelihood ratio,
<li>  	 the width of the motif,
<li>  	 the number of occurrences,
<li>  	 the 0-order portion of the background model,
<li>  	 the size of the training set, and
<li>  	 the type of model (oops, zoops, or anr, which determines the
  	   number of possible different motifs of the given width and
  	   number of occurrences).
</ol>
  
  MEME searches for motifs by performing Expectation Maximization (EM) on a 
  motif model of a fixed width and using an initial estimate of the number of 
  sites.  It then sorts the possible sites according to their probability 
  according to EM.  MEME then and calculates the E-values of the first n sites 
  in the sorted list for different values of n.  This procedure (first EM, 
  followed by computing E-values for different numbers of sites) is repeated 
  with different widths and different initial estimates of the number of 
  sites.  MEME outputs the motif with the lowest E-value.
  
   
<b>  B) NUMBER OF MOTIFS</b>
   
<b>  	-nmotifs < n > </b>   The number of *different* motifs to search
  			for.  MEME will search for and output < n > motifs.
  			Default: 1
   
<p><b>  	-evt < p > </b>	Quit looking for motifs if E-value exceeds < p >.
  			Default: infinite (so by default MEME never quits
  			before -nmotifs < n > have been found.)
   
   
<b>  C) NUMBER OF MOTIF OCCURENCES  </b>
   
<b>  	-nsites < n > </b>
<b>  	-minsites < n > </b>
<b>  	-maxsites < n > </b>
  			The (expected) number of occurrences of each motif.
  			If -nsites is given, only that number of occurrences
  			is tried.  Otherwise, numbers of occurrences between
  			-minsites and -maxsites are tried as initial guesses
  			for the number of motif occurrences.  These
  			switches are ignored if mod = oops.
   
<p>  			Default:

        <p> -minsites sqrt(number sequences)
  	<p>			 -maxsites Default:
  	<br>				zoops 	# of sequences
  	<br>				anr	MIN(5*#sequences, 50)
  
<b>  	-wnsites < n > </b>	The weight on the prior on nsites.  This controls
  			how strong the bias towards motifs with exactly
  			nsites sites (or between minsites and maxsites sites)
  			is.  It is a number in the range [0..1).  The
  			larger it is, the stronger the bias towards 
  			motifs with exactly nsites occurrences is.
<p>  			Default: 0.8
   
<b>  D) MOTIF WIDTH </b>
   
<br><b>  	-w < n >  </b>
<br><b>  	-minw < n > </b>
<br><b>  	-maxw < n >  </b>
<br>  
  			The width of the motif(s) to search for.
  			If -w is given, only that width is tried.
  			Otherwise, widths between -minw and -maxw are tried.
  			Default: -minw  8, -maxw 50 (defined in user.h)
<br>  
  			Note: If < n > is less than the length of the shortest 
  			sequence in the dataset, < n > is reset by MEME to 
  			that value. 
  
<b>  	-nomatrim </b>
<b>  	-wg < a > </b> 
<b>  	-ws < a > </b>
<b>  	-noendgaps </b>
<br>  			These switches control trimming (shortening) of
  			motifs using the multiple alignment method.
  			Specifying -nomatrim causes MEME to skip this and
  			causes the other switches to be ignored.
  			MEME finds the best motif
  			found and then trims (shortens) it using the multiple 
  			alignment method (described below). The number of 
  			occurrences is then adjusted to maximize the motif 
  			E-value, and then the motif width is further
  			shortened to optimize the E-value.
  
<p>  			The multiple alignment method performs a separate 
  			pairwise alignment of the site with the highest
  			probability and each other possible site.
  			(The alignment includes width/2 positions on either 
  			side of the sites.) The pairwise alignment
  			is controlled by the switches:
<br>  				-wg < a > (gap cost; default: 11), 
<br>  				-ws < a > (space cost; default 1), and, 
<br>  				-noendgaps (do not penalize endgaps; default: 
  					penalize endgaps).  
<p>  			The pairwise alignments are then combined and the 
  			method determines the widest section of the motif with 
  			no insertions or deletions.  If this alignment
  		        is shorter than < minw >, it tries to find an alignment
  			allowing up to one insertion/deletion per motif
  			column.  This continues (allowing up to 2, 3 ...
  			insertions/deletions per motif column) until an 
  			alignment of width at least < minw > is found. 
  
  
<b>  E) BACKGROUND MODEL </b>
<b>  	-bfile < bfile >  </b>
<br>	The name of the file containing the background model
  			for sequences.  The background model is the model
  			of random sequences used by MEME.  The background 
  			model is used by MEME 
<br>
<ol>
<li>  				1) during EM as the "null model",
<li>  				2) for calculating the log likelihood ratio
  				   of a motif,
<li>  				3) for calculating the significance (E-value) 
  				   of a motif, and, 
<li>  				4) for creating the position-specific scoring
  				   matrix (log-odds matrix).
</ol>
  
  			By default, the background model is a 0-order Markov 
  			model based on the letter frequencies in the training 
  			set.  
  
<p>  			Markov models of any order can be specified in < bfile > 
  			by listing frequencies of all possible tuples of 
  			length up to order+1.  
  
<p>  			Note that MEME uses only the 0-order portion (single
  			letter frequencies) of the background model for
  			purposes 3) and 4), but uses the full-order model
  			for purposes 1) and 2), above.
  
<p>  			Example: To specify a 1-order Markov background model
  		 		 for DNA, < bfile > might contain the following
  				 lines.  Note that optional comment lines are
  				 by "#" and are ignored by MEME.

<pre>  
  				# tuple   frequency_non_coding
  				a       0.324
  				c       0.176
  				g       0.176
  				t       0.324
  				# tuple   frequency_non_coding
  				aa      0.119
  				ac      0.052
  				ag      0.056
  				at      0.097
  				ca      0.058
  				cc      0.033
  				cg      0.028
  				ct      0.056
  				ga      0.056
  				gc      0.035
  				gg      0.033
  				gt      0.052
  				ta      0.091
  				tc      0.056
  				tg      0.058
  				tt      0.119
</pre>


  
  Sample -bfile files are given in directory tests: 
<br>  	tests/nt.freq (DNA), and 
<br>  	tests/na.freq (amino acid).
  

<b>  F) DNA PALINDROMES AND STRANDS </b>
   
<b>  	-revcomp</b>	motifs occurrences may be on the given DNA strand
  			or on its reverse complement.
<br>  			Default: look for DNA motifs only on the strand given 
  			in the training set.
   
<p><b>  	-pal</b>		
<br>  			Choosing -pal causes MEME to look for palindromes in 
  			DNA datasets.  
<p>  
  			MEME averages the letter frequencies in corresponding 
  			columns of the motif (PSPM) together. For instance, 
  			if the width of the motif is 10, columns 1 and 10, 2 
  			and 9, 3 and 8, etc., are averaged together.  The 
  			averaging combines the frequency of A in one column 
  			with T in the other, and the frequency of C in one 
  			column with G in the other.  
  			If neither option is not chosen, MEME does not 
  			search for DNA palindromes.
  
  
<p> <b>  G) EM ALGORITHM </b>
   
 <p><b> 	-maxiter < n > </b> 
<br>   The number of iterations of EM to run from
  			any starting point.
  			EM is run for < n > iterations or until convergence
  			(see -distance, below) from each starting point.
<br>  			Default: 50
   
<p><b>  	-distance < a >   </b>
<br> The convergence criterion.  MEME stops
  			iterating EM when the change in the
  			motif frequency matrix is less than < a >.
  			(Change is the euclidean distance between
  			two successive frequency matrices.)
<br>  			Default: 0.001
   
<p><b>  	-prior < string > </p>
<br>The prior distribution on the model parameters:
  	<br>	<i>	dirichlet </i>      simple Dirichlet prior
  					This is the default for -dna and 
  					-alph.  It is based on the 
  					non-redundant database letter
  					frequencies.
  	<br>	<i>	dmix</i>		mixture of Dirichlets prior
  					This is the default for -protein. 
  	<br>	<i>	mega</i>		extremely low variance dmix;
  					variance is scaled inversely with
  					the size of the dataset.
  	<br>	<i>	megap</i>		mega for all but last iteration
  					of EM; dmix on last iteration.
  	<br>	<i>	addone</i>		add +1 to each observed count
   

<p><b>   	-b < a > </p>
<br>	  The strength of the prior on model parameters:
  				< a > = 0 means use intrinsic strength of prior
  					for prior = dmix.
<br>  			Defaults:
  				0.01 if prior = dirichlet
  				0 if prior = dmix
   
<p><b>   	-plib < string >  </b>
<br>The name of the file containing the Dirichlet prior
  			in the format of file prior30.plib.
   
   
<p><b>  H) SELECTING STARTS FOR EM </b>
   
<br>  The default is for MEME to search the dataset for good starts for EM.  How 
  the starting points are derived from the dataset is specified by the 
  following switches.
   
<p>  The default type of mapping MEME uses is:
<br>  		-spmap uni for -dna and -alph < string >
<br>  		-spmap pam for -protein
   
<br>  	-spfuzz < a >     The fuzziness of the mapping.
  			Possible values are greater than 0.  Meaning
  			depends on -spmap, see below.
   
<br>  	-spmap < string >  The type of mapping function to use.
<br>  		<i>	uni</i>     Use add-< a > prior when converting a substring
  				to an estimate of theta.
  				Default -spfuzz < a >: 0.5
  		<i>	pam</i>     Use columns of PAM < a > matrix when converting
  				a substring to an estimate of theta.
  				Default -spfuzz < a >: 120 (PAM 120)
   
<p>  			Other types of starting points
  			can be specified using the following switches.
   
<br>  	-cons < string >  Override the sampling of starting points
  			and just use a starting point derived from
  			< string >.
<br>  			This is useful when an actual occurrence of
  			a motif is known and can be used as the
  			starting point for finding the motif.

<h3>  EXAMPLES: </h3>
  
<p><b>Please note</b> the examples below are unedited excerpts of the original MEME documentation.  Bear in mind the EMBASSY and original MEME options may differ in practice (see "1. Command-line arguments").

<p>  The following examples use data files provided in this release of MEME.  
  MEME writes its output to standard output, so you will want to redirect it 
  to a file in order for use with MAST.
   
<p>  1) A simple DNA example:
<br>  	 meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -pal > ex1.html
   
<p>  MEME looks for a single motif in the file crp0.s which contains DNA 
  sequences in FASTA format.  The OOPS model is used so MEME assumes that 
  every sequence contains exactly one occurrence of the motif.  The 
  palindrome switch is given so the motif model (PSPM) is converted into a 
  palindrome by combining corresponding frequency columns.  MEME automatically 
  chooses the best width for the motif in this example since no width was 
  specified.
   
<p>  2) Searching for motifs on both DNA strands:
<br>           meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -revcomp > ex2.html

<p>    This is like the previous example except that the -revcomp switch tells
  MEME to consider both DNA strands, and the -pal switch is absent so the
  palindrome conversion is omitted.  When DNA uses both DNA strands, motif
  occurrences on the two strands may not overlap.  That is, any position
  in the sequence given in the training set may be contained in an occurrence
  of a motif on the positive strand or the negative strand, but not both.
  
<p>  3) A fast DNA example:
<br>  	meme crp0.s -dna -mod oops -revcomp -w 20 > ex3.html
   
<p>  This example differs from example 1) in that MEME is told to only 
  consider motifs of width 20.  This causes MEME to execute about 10 
  times faster.  The -w switch can also be used with protein datasets if 
  the width of the motifs are known in advance.
  
<p>  4) Using a higher-order background model:
<br>  	meme INO_up800.s -dna -mod anr -revcomp -bfile yeast.nc.6.freq > ex4.html
  
<p>  In this example we use -mod anr and -bfile yeast.nc.6.freq.  This specifies 
  that
<br>  	a) the motif may have any number of occurrences in each sequence, and,
<br>  	b) the Markov model specified in yeast.nc.6.freq is used as the 
  	   background model.  This file contains a fifth-order Markov model 
             for the non-coding regions in the yeast genome.
<br>  Using a higher order background model can often result in more sensitive
  detection of motifs.  This is because the background model more accurately
  models non-motif sequence, allowing MEME to discriminate against it and find 
  the true motifs.
  
<p>  5) A simple protein example:
<br>  	meme lipocalin.s -mod oops -maxw 20 -nmotifs 2 > ex5.html

<p>  The -dna switch is absent, so MEME assumes the file lipocalin.s contains 
  protein sequences.  MEME searches for two motifs each of width less than or 
  equal to 20.
  (Specifying -maxw 20 makes MEME run faster since it does not have to 
  consider motifs longer than 20.) Each motif is assumed to occur in each 
  of the sequences because the OOPS model is specified.
   
<p>  6) Another simple protein example:
<br>     	meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -maxw 40 -maxsites 50 > ex6.html

<p>     MEME searches for a motif of width up to 40 with up to 50 occurrences in
  the entire training set.  The ANR sequence model is specified,
  which allows each motif to have any number of occurrences in each sequence.  
  This dataset contains motifs with multiple repeats of motifs in each 
  sequence.  This example is fairly time consuming due to the fact that the 
  time required to initiale the motif probability tables is proportional 
  to < maxw > times < maxsites >.  By default, MEME only looks for motifs up to 
  29 letters wide with a maximum total of number of occurrences equal to twice 
  the number of sequences or 30, whichever is less.
  
<p>  7) A much faster protein example:
<br>  	meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -w 10 -maxsites 30 -nmotifs 3 > ex7.html
  
<p>  This time MEME is constrained to search for three motifs of width exactly 
  ten.  The effect is to break up the long motif found in the previous 
  example.  The -w switch forces motifs to be *exactly* ten letters wide.
  This example is much faster because, since only one width is considered, the
  time to build the motif probability tables is only proportional to 
  < maxsites >.
  
<p>  8) Splitting the sites into three:
<br>  	meme farntrans5.s -mod anr -maxw 12 -nsites 24 -nmotifs 3 > ex8.html
  
<p>  This forces each motif to have 24 occurrences, exactly, and be up to 12 
  letters wide.
  
<p>  9) A larger protein example with E-value cutoff:
<br>  	meme adh.s -mod zoops -nmotifs 20 -evt 0.01 > ex9.html

<p>  In this example, MEME looks for up to 20 motifs, but stops when a motif is
  found with E-value greater than 0.01.  Motifs with large E-values are likely
  to be statistical artifacts rather than biologically significant.

Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter order is used as in the original meme. There are however several unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the "Notes" section below.

<p>Most of the options in the original meme are given in ACD as "advanced" or
"additional" options. -options must be specified on the command-line in order 
to be prompted for a value for "additional" options but "advanced" options 
will never be prompted for.

                                  exactly one occurrence of each motif. This
                                  option is the fastest and most sensitive but
                                  the motifs returned by MEME may be 'blurry'
                                  if any of the sequences is missing them.

                                  sequences. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be more accurate than using the first
                                  option. This option takes more computer time
                                  than the first option (about twice as much)
                                  and is slightly less sensitive to weak

                                  : Any Number of Repetitions. MEME assumes

                                  non-overlapping occurrences of each motif.
                                  This option is useful when you suspect that
                                  motifs repeat multiple times within a single
                                  sequence. In that case, the motifs found
                                  will be much more accurate than using one of
                                  the other options. This option can also be
                                  used to discover repeats within a single

                                  sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat
                                  within a single sequence than the other two

                                  Otherwise, widths between -minw and -maxw

<td>The name of the file containing the background model for sequences. The background model is the model of random sequences used by MEME. The background model is used by MEME 1) during EM as the 'null model', 2) for calculating the log likelihood ratio of a motif, 3) for calculating the significance (E-value) of a motif, and, 4) for creating the position-specific scoring matrix (log-odds matrix). See application documentation for more information.</td>

<tr>
<td>-mod</td>
<td>If you know how occurrences of motifs are distributed in the training set sequences, you can specify it with these options. The default distribution of motif occurrences is assumed to be zero or one occurrence per sequence. oops : One Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that each sequence in the dataset contains exactly one occurrence of each motif. This option is the fastest and most sensitive but the motifs returned by MEME may be 'blurry' if any of the sequences is missing them. zoops : Zero or One Occurrence Per Sequence. MEME assumes that each sequence may contain at most one occurrence of each motif. This option is useful when you suspect that some motifs may be missing from some of the sequences. In that case, the motifs found will be more accurate than using the first option. This option takes more computer time than the first option (about twice as much) and is slightly less sensitive to weak motifs present in all of the sequences. anr : Any Number of Repetitions. MEME assumes each sequence may contain any number of non-overlapping occurrences of each motif. This option is useful when you suspect that motifs repeat multiple times within a single sequence. In that case, the motifs found will be much more accurate than using one of the other options. This option can also be used to discover repeats within a single sequence. This option takes the much more computer time than the first option (about ten times as much) and is somewhat less sensitive to weak motifs which do not repeat within a single sequence than the other two options.</td>

        The motif is preceded by a line starting with
        "letter-probability matrix:" and containing the length of the 
        alphabet, width of the motif, number of occurrences of the motif,
        and the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;-value of the motif.
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Earlier versions
        of MEME gave the posterior probabilities--the probability after 
        applying a prior on letter frequencies--rather than the observed 
        frequencies.
        These versions of MEME also gave the number of &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt;
        positions for the motif rather than the actual number of occurrences.
        The output from these earlier versions of MEME can be distinguished
        by "n=" rather than "nsites=" in the line preceding the matrix.
        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="regular_expression_doc2" href="#regular_expression1"&gt;Regular Expression&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        This is a regular expression (RE) describing the motif.  In each column,
        all letters with observed frequencies greater than 0.2 are shown;
        less-frequent letters are not included in the RE.
        MEME regular expressions are interpreted as follows: 
        single letters match that letter; groups of letters in square brackets 
        match any of the letters in the group.
        Regular expressions can be used for searching for the motif in
        sequences (using, for example,
        &lt;a href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/33/suppl_2/W262"&gt;
         PatMatch
        &lt;/a&gt;
        ) but the search accuracy will usually be better with the PSSM (using,
        for example
        &lt;a href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/mast-intro.html"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.)
      &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a name="motif-summary-doc2" href="#motif-summary"&gt;Motif Summary Tiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
        The motif summary tiling is done using the same algorithm as used by 
        &lt;a href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/mast-intro.html"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.
        The motif occurrences shown in the motif summary
        &lt;b&gt;may not be exactly the same as those reported in each motif section&lt;/b&gt;
        because only motifs with a position &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value of 0.0001 that
        don't overlap other, more significant motif occurrences are shown.
        The format of the machine readable motif-summary is:
        &lt;pre&gt;
        [sequence_name combined_&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value number_of_motif_occurrences [motif_number start_of_motif position_&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value]+]+
        &lt;/pre&gt;
        See the documentation for 
        &lt;a href="http://meme.nbcr.net/meme/mast-output.html"&gt;MAST output&lt;/a&gt;
        for the definition of position and
        combined &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values.
      &lt;/li&gt;

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->
<H3>1. Command-line arguments</H3>
The following original MEME options are not supported:
<br><pre>
-h         : Use -help to get help information.
-dna	   : EMBOSS will specify whether sequences use a DNA alphabet 
             automatically.
-protein   : EMBOSS will specify whether sequences use a protein alphabet 
             automatically.
</pre>

<p>
The following additional options are provided:
<br><pre>
outfile    : Application output that was normally written to stdout.
</pre>

Note: ememe makes a temporary local copy of its input sequence data.  You must ensure there is sufficient disk space for this in the directory that ememe is run.


<H3>2. Installing EMBASSY MEME</H3>
The EMBASSY MEME package contains "wrapper" applications providing an EMBOSS-style interface to the applications in the original MEME package version 3.0.14 developed by Timothy L. Bailey.  Please read the file README in the EMBASSY MEME package distribution for installation instructions.


<H3>3. Installing original MEME</H3>
To use EMBASSY MEME, you will first need to download and install the original MEME package:
<pre>
WWW home:       http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/
Distribution:   http://meme.nbcr.net/downloads/old_versions/  
</pre>
Please read the file README in the the original MEME package distribution for installation instructions.


<H3>4. Setting up MEME</H3>
For the EMBASSY MEME package to work, the directory containing the original MEME executables *must* be in your path. For example if you executables were installed to "/usr/local/meme/bin", then type:
<pre>
set path=(/usr/local/meme/bin/ $path)
rehash
</pre>


<H3> 5. Getting help </H3>
Once you have installed the original MEME, type
<pre>
meme > meme.txt 
mast > mast.txt 
</pre>
to retrieve the meme and mast documentation into text files. The same documentation is given here and in the ememe documentation.
<p>Please read the 'Notes' section below for a description of the differences between the original and EMBASSY MEME, particularly which application command line options are supported.

<H3>Input data</H3>


<H3>Sequence input </H3>
Note: ememe makes a temporary local copy of its input sequence data.  You must ensure there is sufficient disk space for this in the directory that ememe is run.
<p>The user must provide the full filename of a sequence database for the sequence input ("seqset" ACD option), not an indirect reference, e.g. a USA is NOT acceptable.  This is because meme (which ememe wraps) does not support USAs, and a full sequence database is too big to write to a temporary file that the original meme would understand.
