<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Crystalball is an application invented by Scott Markel and Darryl Leon
in their book "Sequence Analysis in a Nutshell". They put the
description into Appendix D with the comment:

<p>
<i>Here's a program we're working on. When it's finished we plan to
donate it to the EMBOSS package. It may take us a while, so be
patient</i>

<p>
It took just 30 minutes from seeing a draft of Appendix D to sending
Scott the ACD file and then the C source code.

<p>
Like Scott and Darryl, we put the program into an EMBASSY package
called "appendixd" in the hope that nobody takes it too seriously,
although we suspect the results are more accurate than one would
reasonably be entitled to expect.



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

Scott and Darryl defined the ACD interface in the book, together with
3 of the responses.

<p>
We added the others in the same spirit.

<p>
No attempt is made to change the output when the input sequence changes.

    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>crystalball</b> reads any normal sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/crystalball.input" -->





<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<b>crystalball</b> 
outputs a plain text file with a one-line response to each of the
input options.
