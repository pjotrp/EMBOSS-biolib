Function

   RNA eval

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAeval.

   The original program has additional inputs and produces different
   outputs, depending on the options selected. In the EMBASSY
   implementation it is split into vrnaeval and vrnaevalpair

Algorithm

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

Usage

   Here is a sample session with vrnaeval


% vrnaeval

Author(s)

   This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Ivo
   Hofacker as part of his VIENNA package.

   Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
   version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
   that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
   before publication.

   Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
   not to the original author.
