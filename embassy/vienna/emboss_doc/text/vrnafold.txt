Function

   Calculate secondary structures of RNAs

Description

   This is a port of the Vienna RNA package program RNAfold.

   The original program has additional inputs and produces different
   outputs, depending on the options selected. In the EMBASSY
   implementation it is split into vrnafold for a single sequence and
   vrnafoldpair for a pair of sequences

Algorithm

   See the original documentation for the Vienna RNA package
   http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~ivo/RNA/

Author(s)

                    This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Ivo
                    Hofacker as part of his VIENNA package.

                    Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
                    version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
                    that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
                    before publication.

                    Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
                    not to the original author.

Target users

                    This program is intended to be used by everyone and everything, from
                    naive users to embedded scripts.
