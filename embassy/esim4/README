Installation from .tar file.


1) Go to the emboss directory 
cd EMBOSS-x.x.x

2) make new directory embassy if it does not exist already.
mkdir embassy

3) Go into that directory
cd embassy

4) unzip and untar the file
gunzip ESIM4.tar.gz
tar xvf ESIM4.tar

5) go into the esim4 directory
cd ESIM4

6) configure and compile
./configure (use same options as you used to compile emboss)
make
make install

7. To build a regular (nonEMBOSS) version go to the source directory and do:

gmake altMakefile

which will produce a file "sim4".


This distribution of sim4/esim4 built and ran with both gcc and the
SUNpro compiler on Solaris 8.
