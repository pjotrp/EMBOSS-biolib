<b>cons</b> calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
alignment.  To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
matrix are used to calculate a score at each position in the alignment. 
<P>

   The "plurality" option allows the user to set a cut-off for the
number of positive matches below which there is no consensus. 
<P>

    The "identity" option provides the facility of setting the required
number of identities at a site for it to give a consensus at that
position.  Therefore, if this is set to the number of sequences in the
alignment only columns of identities contribute to the consensus. 
<P>

    The "setcase" option sets the threshold for the positive matches
above which the consensus is is upper-case and below which the consensus
is in lower-case. 




<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

Here is a sample session with cons:

   -setcase            float      Define a threshold above which the consensus
                                  is given in uppercase.
   -identity           integer    Only match those with N identices in all

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

The USA of a set of aligned sequences.

    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The output consists of a line "Consensus" followed by one of more lines
holding the consensus sequence. For example:

<P>
<HR>
<pre>
Consensus 
tagctga-ct-ac-ggactgatgcgt
</pre>
<HR>















<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
   -->

It uses the standard set of scoring matrix data files.
<P>

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
