    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or
indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.
This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described
pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

<p>

Some research applications require knowledge of the database sequence(s)
that corresponds to the sequence(s) given in a pdb file.  A 'swissprot:pdb
equivalence' file listing accession numbers and swissprot database
identifiers for certain pdb code is available, but is not in a format that
is consistent with flat file formats used for protein structural data in
emboss.  pdbtosp parses the swissprot:pdb equivalence in its raw format
and converts it to an embl-like format.   

<p>

pdbtosp parses the swissprot:pdb equivalence table available at URL (1)
(1) http://www.expasy.ch/cgi-bin/lists?pdbtosp.txt
and writes the data out in embl-like format file (Figure 2). The raw (input)
file can be obtained by doing a "save as ... text format" from the web page
(1).   No changes are made to the data other than changing the format in
which it is held.  The input and output files are specified by the user.










<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->

pdbtosp relies on finding a line beginning with '____  _' in the input file
(all lines up to and including this one are ignored). Lines of code data
are then parsed, up until the first blank line.    












<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>pdbtosp</b> reads any normal sequence USAs.

    Output file format

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 

        If you wish to include the standard description of the avalable
	report formats, use:
<p>

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-rformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  The available format names are: embl,
genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

An excerpt from the swissprot:pdb equivalence file in embl-like format is
shown below.  The records used to describe an entry are as follows.

<p>

(1)  EN - PDB identifier code.  This is the 4-character PDB identifier code.

<p>

(2)  NE - Number of entries.  This is the number of accession numbers that
were given for that pdb code in the equivalence file.

<p>

(3)  IN - Code line.  The swissprot database identifier code and accession
number are given preceeding ID and ACC respectively.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

None.

pdbtosp is used to create the emboss data file Epdbtosp.dat that is
included in the emboss distribution.
