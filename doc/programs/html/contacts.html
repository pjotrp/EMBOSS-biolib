    Description

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly or
indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and scop.
This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline described in an
accompanying document.  We provide the software in the hope that it will
be useful.  The applications were designed for specific research purposes
and may not be useful or reliable in contexts other than the described
pipeline.  The development of the suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to
whom enquiries and bug reports should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
**
Knowledge of the physical contacts that amino acid residues within a
protein or domain make with one another is required for several different
analyses.  contacts calculates intra-chain residue-residue contact data
from protein and domain coordinate files.     











<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->

Contact between two residues is defined as when the van der Waals surface
of any atom of the first residue comes within the threshold contact
distance of the van der Waals surface of any atom of the second residue.
The threshold contact distance is a user-defined distance with a default
value of 1 Angstrom.

    Usage

<p>

contacts reads a directory of domain or protein coordinate files and writes
a contacts file of intra-chain residue-residue contact data in embl-like
format for each file in the input directory.  Each output file contains
residue contact data for every chain of every model in a protein coordinate
file, or contact data for the single scop domain where a domain coordinate
file is read.  The paths and extensions for the coordinate (input) and
contact (output) files are specified by the user.  The scop domain or pdb
identifier codes are used as appropriate to name the output files.  A log
file is also written.
                

<p>

The embl-like format used for the contact files (below) uses the following
records:

<p>

(1)  ID - either the 4-character PDB identifier code (where clean protein
coordinate files are used as input) or the 7-character domain identifier
code taken from scop (where domain coordinate files were used as input; see
documentation for the EMBOSS application scope for further info.)

<p>

(2)  DE - bibliographic information.  The text "Residue-residue contact
data" is always given.

<p>

(4)  EX - experimental information. The value of the threshold contact
distance is given as a floating point number after 'THRESH'. The number of
models and number of polypeptide chains are given after 'NMOD' and 'NCHA'
respectively. domain coordinate files a 1 is always given. Following the EX
record, the file will have a section containing a CN, IN and SM records
(see below) for each chain. The sections for each chain of a model are given
after the MO record.

<p>

(5) MO - model number. The number given in brackets after this record
indicates the start of a section of model-specific data.

<p>

(6) CN - chain number.  The number given in brackets after this record
indicates the start of a section of chain-specific data.

<p>

(7) IN - chain specific data. The character given after ID is the PDB chain
identifier taken from the input file, (a '.` given in cases where a chain
identifier was not specified in the original pdb file or, for domain
coordinate files, the domain is comprised of more than one domain).  The
number of amino acid residues comprising the chain (or the chains from
which a domain is comprised) is given after NR. The number of residue-residue
contacts is given after NSMCON.

<p>

(8) SM - Line of residue contact data. Pairs of amino acid identifiers and
residue numbers are delimited by a ';'. Residue numbers are taken from the 
clean coordinate file and give a correct index into the sequence (i.e. they
are not necessarily the same as the original pdb file).

<p>

(9) XX - used for spacing.

<p>

(10) // - given on the last line of the file only.

<p>

Note - SM records are used for contacts between either either side-chain
or main-chain atoms as defined above.  In a future implementation, SS will
be used for side-chain only contacts, MM will be used for main-chain only
contacts, and there will probably be several other forms of contact too.

    Data files

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

contacts uses a data file containing van der Waals radii for atoms in
proteins (below).  The file Evdw.dat is such a data file and is part

contacts generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown (below). If
there is a problem in processing a coordinate file, three lines containing
the record '//', the scop domain or pdb identifier code and an error message
respectively are written. The text 'WARN  file open error filename',
'ERROR file read error filename' or 'ERROR file write error filename ' will
be reported when an error was encountered during a file open, read or write
respectively.  Various other error messages may also be given (in case of
difficulty email Jon Ison, jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

A 'protein coordinate file' contains protein coordinate and other data
extracted from a single pdb file.  The files, generated by pdbparse, are in
embl-like format and contain 'cleaned-up' data that is self-consistent and
error-corrected.

<p>

A 'domain coordinate file' contains coordinate and other data for a single
scop domain.  The files are generated by domainer and are in embl-like and
pdb formats.

<p>

siggen uses contacts files as input.
