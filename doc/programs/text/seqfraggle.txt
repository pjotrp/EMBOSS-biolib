1.0 SUMMARY

   Removes fragments from DHF files (domain hits files) or other files of
   sequences.

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SEQFRAGGLE reads a directory of domain hits files and for each
   individual file writes a new domain hits file in which sequence hits
   deemed to be fragments are removed. Alternatively, SEQFRAGGLE will
   read and write any supported sequence set format, e.g. the common
   alignment formats. The base names of the output files are the same as
   the input files. The paths and file extensions for the output files
   (input and output) are specified by the user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain hits file is explained in the SEQSEARCH
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the domain hits file is explained in the SEQSEARCH
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   None.

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-dhfin]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain
   hits files) or other sequence files (input). A 'domain hits file'
   contains database hits (sequences) with domain classification
   information, in FASTA or EMBL formats. The hits are relatives to a
   SCOP or CATH family and are found from a search of a sequence
   database. Files containing hits retrieved by PSIBLAST are generated by
   using SEQSEARCH. Alternatively, SEQFRAGGLE will accept sequence or
   sequence sets in any of the common formats. Directory with files ./
   -thresh This option specifies the percentage of median length for
   definition of fragments. SEQFRAGGLE first determines the median length
   of all the sequences in the input file, then discards any hit
   sequences which are not within a threshold percentage of the median
   length. The remaining sequences are written to the output file. Any
   integer value 50
   [-dhfout]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the location of DHF files (domain
   hits files) (output). A 'domain hits file' contains database hits
   (sequences) with domain classification information, in FASTA or EMBL
   formats. The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH family and are found
   from a search of a sequence database. Files containing hits retrieved
   by PSIBLAST are generated by using SEQSEARCH. Alternatively,
   SEQFRAGGLE will write output files in any of the common formats.
   Directory ./
   Additional (Optional) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of SEQFRAGGLE is shown below.

Unix % seqfraggle

s.
Location of DHF files (domain hits files) or other sequence files for input [./

Processing /test_data/55074.dhf
Unix %

   All the domain hits files with the file extension .dhf (specified in
   the ACD file) in the directory /test_data were read. In this case two
   files called 55074.dhf and 54894.dhf were read. Two domain hits files
   (with the extension .dhf specified in ACD) with fragment sequences
   removed were written to /test_data/seqfraggle.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


seqfraggle test_data test_data -thresh 50

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   None.

  8.1 GLOSSARY OF FILE TYPES

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain hits file DHF format (FASTA-like format with domain
   classification information). Database hits (sequences) with domain
   classification information. The hits are relatives to a SCOP or CATH
   family and are found from a search of a sequence database. SEQSEARCH
   (hits retrieved by PSIBLAST) N.A.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Fragmentary protein sequences occur in the sequence databases but are
   not necessarily biologically significant. Certain analyses will be
   distorted if fragmentary sequences are not filtered from the dataset.
   SEQFRAGGLE reads domain hits files (or a set of sequences in another
   format) and writes new domain hits file in which sequences deemed to
   be fragments are ommitted.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   SEQFRAGGLE first determines the median length of all the sequences in
   the input file, then discards any hit sequences which are not within a
   threshold percentage (user defined) of the median length. The
   remaining sequences are written to the output file.

   APPLICATION DESCRIPTION
   SEQSEARCH Generate DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits
   (sequences) from a DAF file (domain alignment file) or other sequences
   by using PSI-BLAST.
   SEQWORDS Generates DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits
   (sequences) for nodes in a DCF file (domain classification file) by
   keyword search of UniProt.
   SEQFRAGGLE Removes fragments from DHF files (domain hits files) or
   other files of sequences.
   SEQSORT Reads DHF files (domain hits files) of database hits
   (sequences) and removes hits of ambiguous classification.
   SEQNR Removes redundancy from files of database hits (sequences).
