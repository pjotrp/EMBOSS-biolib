Function

   Creates a consensus from multiple alignments
   
Description

   cons calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
   alignment. To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
   matrix are used to calculate a score at each position in the
   alignment.
   
   The "plurality" option allows the user to set a cut-off for the number
   of positive matches below which there is no consensus.
   
   The "identity" option provides the facility of setting the required
   number of identities at a site for it to give a consensus at that
   position. Therefore, if this is set to the number of sequences in the
   alignment only columns of identities contribute to the consensus.
   
   The "setcase" option sets the threshold for the positive matches above
   which the consensus is is upper-case and below which the consensus is
   in lower-case.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with cons:

% cons
Creates a consensus from multiple alignments
Input sequence set: aligned.fasta
Output file [outfile.cons]: aligned.cons

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-msf]               seqset     File containing a sequence alignment.
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     Scoring matrix
   -plurality          float      Defines the number of positive scoring
                                  matches below which there is no consensus.
   -setcase            float      Define a threshold above which the consensus
                                  is given in uppercase.
   -identity           integer    Only match those with N identices in all
                                  sequences.

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-msf]
   (Parameter 1) File containing a sequence alignment. Readable sequences
   Required
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -datafile Scoring matrix Comparison matrix file in EMBOSS data path
   EBLOSUM62 for protein
   EDNAMAT for DNA
   -plurality Defines the number of positive scoring matches below which
   there is no consensus. Any integer value Half the total sequence
   weighting
   -setcase Define a threshold above which the consensus is given in
   uppercase. Any integer value 0
   -identity Only match those with N identices in all sequences. Integer
   0 or more 0
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   The USA of a set of aligned sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output consists of a line "Consensus" followed by one of more
   lines holding the consensus sequence. For example:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Consensus
tagctga-ct-ac-ggactgatgcgt
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Data files

   It uses the standard set of scoring matrix data files.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
