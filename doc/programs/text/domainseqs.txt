1.0 SUMMARY

   Adds sequence records to a DCF file (domain classification file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINSEQS parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a
   file containing the same data, except that domain sequence information
   derived from structural and, optionally, sequence databases are added.
   Domain sequences are taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate
   files) and (optionally) the swissprot database. If the swissprot
   sequence is used, DOMAINSEQS requires a swissprot:PDB equivalence file
   that gives the accession number of each PDB file corresponding to the
   domains in the DCF file. The path for the CCF files (input) and names
   of DCF files (input and output) are specified by the user. A log file
   is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   If the user specified retrieval of sequences from a sequence database,
   DOMAINSEQS uses a swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated by using
   PDBTOSP.

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-dcfin]
   (Parameter 1) This option specifies the name of DCF file (domain
   classification file) (input). A 'domain classification file' contains
   classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF
   format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
   CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by
   using DOMAINSEQS. Input file Required
   [-dpdb]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the location of domain CCF file
   (clean coordinate files) (input). A 'clean cordinate file' contains
   coordinate and other data for a single PDB file or a single domain
   from SCOP or CATH, in CCF format (EMBL-like). The files, generated by
   using PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain 'cleaned-up'
   data that is self-consistent and error-corrected. Records for residue
   solvent accessibility and secondary structure are added to the file by
   using PDBPLUS. Directory ./
   -getswiss Retrieve swissprot sequence. Toggle value Yes/No N
   -pdbtosp This option specifies the name of the pdbcodes to swissprot
   indexing file. The swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated by
   PDBTOSP and is part of the emboss distribution. Input file Required
   [-dcfout]
   (Parameter 3) This option specifies the name of DCF file (domain
   classification file) (output). A 'domain classification file' contains
   classification and other data for domains from SCOP or CATH, in DCF
   format (EMBL-like). The files are generated by using SCOPPARSE and
   CATHPARSE. Domain sequence information can be added to the file by
   using DOMAINSEQS. Output file domainseqs.out
   [-errf]
   (Parameter 4) This option specifies the name of log file for the
   build. The log file contains messages about any errors arising while
   domainseqs ran. Output file domainseqs.log
   Additional (Optional) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -datafile This option specifies the residue substitution matrix, which
   is used for sequence comparison. Comparison matrix file in EMBOSS data
   path EBLOSUM62
   -gapopen This option specifies the gap insertion penalty. This is the
   score taken away when a gap is created. The best value depends on the
   choice of comparison matrix. The default value assumes you are using
   the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix
   for nucleotide sequences. Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0 10.0
   for any sequence
   -gapextend This option specifies the gap extension penalty. This is
   added to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap.
   This is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
   long gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
   should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or
   both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors in
   which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this
   result by setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using
   the gap extension penalty to control gap scoring. Floating point
   number from 0.0 to 10.0 0.5 for any sequence
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of DOMAINSEQS is shown below.

Adds sequence records to a DCF file (domain classification file).

ta
Retrieve swissprot sequence [N]: y
Name of the pdbcodes to swissprot indexing file (EMBL-like format): Epdbtosp.da

Name of domain classification file for output (DCF format) [domainseqs.out]: /t

Warning: No accession number found for domain d1cs4a_

//

%

   The DCF file (domain classification file) lacking sequence information
   called /test_data/all.scop was parsed and a DCF file with sequence
   information called /test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop was written. The
   file Epdbtosp.dat was queried for accession numbers of PDB files
   corresponding to the domains in all.scop, but no accession numbers
   were found for either of the domains d1ii7a_ or d1cs4a_. A log file
   called /test_data/domainseqs/domainseqs.log was written.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.

domainseqs /test_data/all.scop /test_data -getswiss Y -pdbtosp Epdbtosp.dat
/test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop -errf /test_data/domainseqs/domainseqs.log

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   The swissprot:PDB equivalence file available as part of the EMBOSS
   distribution does not contain accession numbers for all PDB files and
   covers only a relatively small proportion of domains in SCOP.

8.0 NOTES

   DOMAINSEQS will not attempt to retrieve a swissprot sequence for any
   domains comprised of more than a single segment, i.e. for domains
   whose NC record in the DCF file has a value other than 1 (see
   SCOPPARSE documentation).
   The region of sequence to retrieve is identified by alignment of the
   sequence from the CCF file (structural database) to the full length
   sequences in swissprot. If this were to be done for segmented domains,
   the start and end point for the retrieved sequence (relative to the
   full length sequence) might actually include a completely different
   domain.
   Consider :
   (A) represents a sequence from the coordinate file for a segmented
   domain D1
   (B) represents the full-length swissprot sequence, it includes D1, but
   D1 is split by a second domain D2

                 D1
  (A)  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

          D1         D2        D1
  (B) XXXXXXXXXX-----------XXXXXXXXXXX

   It should be clear that for an alignment retrieving B, the start and
   end points for the retrieved sequence would be misleading.
   The user should be aware that sequences from the domain CCF file for
   domains comprised of more than a single segment are not biologically
   significant, as the sequences are derived from different segments of
   one or more chains. However, such sequences might be acceptable for
   redundancy calculations (e.g. by using DOMAINNR) because two redundant
   domains made of similar fragments will have similar sequences, so the
   redundancy should be detectable.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Domain sequences are not given in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files,
   but are required for many analyses and for convenience should,
   ideally, be provided along with the classification itself. DOMAINSEQS
   reads a DCF file (domain classificaiton file) that lacks sequence
   information and writes one containing sequence information.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   In order to find the start and end of a domain in a sequence from
   swissprot, the domain sequence from the domain CCF file is aligned to
   the full length protein sequence from swissprot. Alignment is
   performed first by string handling and if that fails, by using the
   EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment
   algorithm. Gap insertion and extension penalties used in the
   alignments are user-specified.
