Function

   Match large sequences against one or more other sequences

Description

   This is a rough and ready local alignment program for large sequences.
   The reason it is rough and ready is that wordmatch is used to find all
   the word matches between the first sequence and another sequence. Then
   by calculating the highest score for a diagonal we can then use this
   as the centre point for a Smith-Waterman type calculation of a width
   given by the user. So a narrow diagonal Smith-Waterman is calculated
   hence the results will be rough but due to the space saving much
   larger sequences can be aligned.

Input file format

   wordfinder reads two sequence USAs of the same type. They must both be
   protein or both be nucleic acid sequences.

   [an error has occurred processing this directive]

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.

   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs

   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/AlignFormats.html for further
   information on alignment formats.

   The output alignment is in simple format by default.

   [an error has occurred processing this directive]

   The file 'wordfinder.error' will contain any errors that occured
   during the program. This may be that wordmatch could not find any
   matches hence no suitable start point is found for the smith-waterman
   calculation.

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAMAT is used. Others can be specified.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   The time this program takes to do an alignment depends very much on
   the word size. For short sequences a short word size (e.g. 4) can make
   it take a very long time. Large word sizes (e.g. 30) for sequences
   that are very similar give a very quick result. The default of 16
   should give reasonable fast alignments.

   Because it does a Smith & Waterman alignment (albeit in a narrow
   region around the diagonal shown to be the 'best' by a word match),
   this program can use huge amounts of memory if the sequences are
   large.

   Because the alignment is made within a narrow area each side of the
   'best' diagonal, if there are sufficient indels between the two
   sequences, then the path of the Smith & Waterman alignment can wander
   outside of this area. Making the width larger can avoid this problem,
   but you then use more memory.

   The longer the sequences and the wider the specified alignment width,
   the more memory will be used.

   If the program terminates due to lack of memory you can try the
   following:

   Run the UNIX command 'limit' to see if your stack or memory usage have
   been limited and if so, run 'unlimit', (e.g.: '% unlimit stacksize').
