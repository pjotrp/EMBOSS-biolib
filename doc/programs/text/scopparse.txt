1.0 SUMMARY

   Reads raw SCOP classification files and writes a DCF file (domain
   classification file) Reads raw SCOP classification files and writes a
   DCF file (domain classification file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SCOPPARSE parses the dir.cla.scop.txt and dir.des.scop.txt SCOP
   classification files, e.g. available at URLs:
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.cla.scop.txt_1.57
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.des.scop.txt_1.57
   The format of these files is explained at URL:
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/release-notes-1.55.html
   SCOPPARSE writes the classification to a DCF file (EMBL-like format).
   No changes are made to the data other than changing the format in
   which it is held. The file does not include domain sequence
   information. The input and output files are specified by the user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   An excerpt from the dir.cla.scop.txt (Figure 1) and dir.des.scop.txt

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   An example of the DCF output file is shown in Figure 3. The records
   used to describe an entry are as follows. Records (4) to (9) are used
   to describe the position of the domain in the SCOP hierarchy.
   (1) ID - Domain identifier code. This is a 7-character code that
   uniquely identifies the domain in SCOP. It is identical to the first 7
   characters of a line in the SCOP classification file. The first
   character is always 'D', the next four characters are the PDB
   identifier code, the fifth character is the PDB chain identifier to
   which the domain belongs (a '.' is given in cases where the domain is
   composed of multiple chains, a '_' is given where a chain identifier
   was not specified in the PDB file) and the final character is the
   number of the domain in the chain (for chains comprising more than one
   domain) or '_' (the chain comprises a single domain only).
   (2) EN - PDB identifier code. This is the 4-character PDB identifier
   code of the PDB entry containing the domain.
   (3) TY - domain type. "CATH" or "SCOP" is given ("SCOP" for DCF files
   generated by using cathparse).
   (4) SI - SCOP Sunid's. The integers preceeding the codes CL, FO, SF,
   FA, DO, SO and DD are the SCOP sunids for Class, Fold, Superfamily,
   Family, Domain, Source and domain data respectively. These numbers
   uniquely identify the appropriate node in the SCOP parsable files.
   (5) CL - Domain class. It is identical to the text given after 'Class'
   in the SCOP classification file.
   (6) FO - Domain fold. It is identical to the text given after 'Fold'
   in the SCOP classification file.
   (7) SF - Domain superfamily. It is identical to the text given after
   'Superfamily' in the SCOP classification file.
   (8) FA - Domain family. It is identical to the text given after
   'Family' in the SCOP classification file.
   (9) DO - Domain name. It is identical to the text given after
   'Protein' in the SCOP classification file.
   (10) OS - Source of the protein. It is identical to the text given
   after 'Species' in the SCOP classification file.
   (11) DS - Sequence of the domain according to the PDB file. This
   sequence is taken from the domain clean coordinate file generated by
   DOMAINER. The DS record will only be present if the DCF file has been
   processed using DOMAINSEQS.
   (12) NC - Number of chains comprising the domain, or number of
   segments from the same chain that the domain is comprised of. NC is
   usually 1. If the number of chains is greater than 1, then the domain
   entry will have a section containing a CN and a CH record (see below)
   for each chain.
   (13) CN - Chain number. The number given in brackets after this record
   indicates the start of the data for the relevent chain.
   (14) CH - Domain definition. The character given before CHAIN is the
   PDB chain identifier (a '.' is given in cases where a chain identifier
   was not specified in the DCF file), the strings before START and END
   give the start and end positions respectively of the domain in the PDB
   file (a '.' is given in cases where a position was not specified).
   Note that the start and end positions refer to residue numbering given
   in the original PDB file and therefore must be treated as strings.
   (15) XX - used for spacing.
   (16) // - used to delimit records for a domain.

   file Required
   [-infileb]
   (Parameter 2) This option specifies the name of raw SCOP description
   file dir.des.scop.txt_X.XX (input). This is the raw SCOP description
   file available at
   http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/dir.des.scop.txt_1.57. Input
   file Required
   -nosegments This option specifies whether to omit domains comprising
   of more than one segment. This is necessary if a continuous residue
   sequence is required. Boolean value Yes/No No

   -nominor This option specifies whether to omit domains from minor
   classes (defined as anything not in class 'All alpha proteins', 'All
   beta proteins', 'Alpha and beta proteins (a/b)' or 'Alpha and beta
   proteins (a+b)'). This is necessary or appropriate for many analyses.
   Boolean value Yes/No No

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   None.

8.0 NOTES

   Some SCOP domains are comprised of more than one segments of
   polypeptide chain, these segments belonging to a single or more than
   one polypeptide chains. It is debatable whether a domain (using the
   widely accepted definition) can truly consist of regions from more
   than polypeptide. Accordingly, SCOPPARSE gives the option of omitting
   from the output file domains that consist of more than one segment and
   domains that consist of more than one segment where the segments are
   from different chains.
   SCOP includes several minor classes which are not appropriate for some
   anaylses. Accordingly, SCOPPARSE gives the option to omit domains from
   minor classes. This is defined as anything not in class 'All alpha
   proteins', 'All beta proteins', 'Alpha and beta proteins (a/b)' or
   'Alpha and beta proteins (a+b)'

  8.1 GLOSSARY OF FILE TYPES

   FILE TYPE FORMAT DESCRIPTION CREATED BY SEE ALSO
   Domain classification file (for SCOP) DCF format (EMBL-like format for
   domain classification data). Classification and other data for domains
   from SCOP. The file is in DCF format (EMBL-like). SCOPPARSE Domain
   sequence information can be added to the file by using DOMAINSEQS.

8.3 DEPRECATED RECORDS

   The following records for database sequence are no longer used in a
   DCF file.
   (1) AC - Accession number of the domain sequence. This record will
   only be present if the DCF file has been processed using DOMAINSEQS
   and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding to the
   domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated by
   PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
   (2) SP - Swissprot code of the domain sequence. This record will only
   be present if the domain classification file has been processed using
   DOMAINSEQS and if an swissprot code for the PDB file corresponding to
   the domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file (generated
   by PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.
   (3) RA - Position of domain in swissprot sequence. The integers
   preceeding START and END give the start and end points respectively of
   the domain sequence relative to the full-length swissprot sequence.
   (4) SQ - Sequence of the domain according to swissprot. This sequence
   is taken from the swissprot database. The SQ record will only be
   present if the SCOP classification file has been processed using
   DOMAINSEQS and if an accession number for the PDB file corresponding
   to the domain is given in the swissprot:PDB equivalence file
   (generated by PDBTOSP) that DOMAINSEQS makes use of.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   The raw SCOP classification files are inconvenient for some uses
   because the text describing the domain classification is given in a
   different file to the classification itself, the file formats are not
   easily extended and differ from other related classifications such as
   CATH. SCOPPARSE reads the raw SCOP classification files and writes a
   single file in DCF (EMBL-like) format, which is an easier format to
   work with, is more human-readable and is more extensible than the
   native SCOP database format.

10.0 ALGORITHM
