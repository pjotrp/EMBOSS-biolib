Description

   This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly
   or indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and
   scop. This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline
   described in an accompanying document. We provide the software in the
   hope that it will be useful. The applications were designed for
   specific research purposes and may not be useful or reliable in
   contexts other than the described pipeline. The development of the
   suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to whom enquiries and bug reports
   should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   Global analyses of protein structure require direct access to the
   co-ordinate data held in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000).
   However, the text files provided are notoriously difficult to parse
   reliably, the problems arising from errors in individual PDB files and
   an awkward and inconsistent file format, which has evolved over some
   30 years in a rather ad hoc manner. A difficult aspect of parsing is
   determining the residue sequence and ensuring that the atomic
   co-ordinates are assigned to the correct position in the sequence in
   the relevant data structure; residue numbers must be treated as
   strings and a sequential numerical numbering scheme is not
   consistently used. While extensive validation is now performed on
   deposited data, including comparisons of PDB SEQRES records (used to
   hold the protein sequence) and the sequence derived from the
   co-ordinate records, there is a legacy of PDB files that predate these
   quality control measures. There is therefore a need for a source of
   protein co-ordinate data that provides fast and convenient access,
   correctly employs a consistent residue numbering scheme. pdbparse will
   parse pdb files and, where protein co-ordinates are present, generate
   'cleaned up' files of co-ordinate data corresponding to whole pdb
   files. These files contain corrections to some of the errors and
   inconsistencies in the original PDB file, contain minimal
   bibliographic data, and use a highly parsable and self-consistent
   format.

   Some of tasks and difficulties involved in parsing a PDB file are
   summarised below.

   Identify molecule type (protein, nucleic acid or polysaccharide.) -
   Not clearly indicated.

   Count the number of models and find the start of the co-ordinates for
   each. - MODEL and ENDMDL records may or may not be given for NMR
   structures with a single model only.

   Determine the number and length of each chain. - The SEQRES records
   are awkward to parse and in some cases the listed number of residues
   differs from the indicated number. SEQRES records do not consistently
   give the sequences for small molecules listed in the ATOM records.
   Rarely, chains are given in the SEQRES records but are missing from
   the ATOM records.

   Extract co-ordinates for individual chains. - Certain files do not
   contain any TER records or have multiple chains that are not delimited
   by TER records. Multiple TER records are given for a single chain
   where the co-ordinates are for fragments of a protein digest.

   Occasionally, the TER record does not delimit the protein and
   heterogen atoms but is given after the final heterogen atom. The order
   of chains in the SEQRES records may not agree with the order given in
   the ATOM records.

   Errors may occur in the use of chain identifiers, especially for N and
   C-terminal residues.

   Extract co-ordinates for non-covalently associated species. - Chain
   identifiers are not consistently used and when present may be
   different to that of the chain to which the group is associated.

   Heterogen atoms are usually listed after the TER record for the
   appropriate chain, but occasionally are listed together after the last
   chain in the structure.

   Determine residue numbering at the N-terminus. - N-terminal MET
   residues and N-terminal blocking groups are often numbered zero
   (rather than 1) but this also occurs for other N-terminal residue. In
   some files, for reasons of alignment, the N-terminal residue is
   assigned a negative number and the residue C-terminal to residue -1
   can be numbered +1 or 0. Sometimes the indicated starting residue
   number is either higher or lower than that suggested by the SEQRES
   records.

   Determine the sequence of residues and ensure that the atomic
   co-ordinates are assigned to the correct position in sequence in the
   relevant data structure. - In some cases the residue numbering in the
   ATOM records does not agree at all with the order of residues in the
   SEQRES records, for example in cases where there are co-ordinates for
   a fragment and residue numbering is relative to the full length
   protein. Non-sequential and character-based numbering systems are used
   where the numbering is relative to a sequence or topological
   alignment. For example, insertion codes (characters) are used in cases
   where numbering is given relative to a reference protein and the
   homologue possess certain residue that the reference protein lacks.

   N-terminal MET residues and N-terminal blocking groups listed in the
   ATOM records are frequently missing from the SEQRES records. Other N
   and C-terminal residues are occasionally ommitted from the SEQRES
   records.

   Incorrect residue identifiers result in further inconsistencies
   between the ATOM and SEQRES records.

   Process jumps in the residue numbering within the lists of ATOM
   records. - Such jumps arise systematically, for example, in cases
   where parts of the structure could not be refined, or where residue
   numbering is given relative to a reference protein and the homologue
   lacks a certain residue in the reference protein. Other jumps are the
   result of errors.

   Process residue numbering for heterogeneous residue positions. -
   Residue numbering for heterogeneous positions, which arise if the
   protein is a naturally occurring mixture or if a residue has been
   partly chemically modified, is not handled consistently. For example,
   both insertion codes and non-sequential numbers are used. Further, the
   position of the insertion code is the same as that used in alternative
   residue numbering schemes and in some cases to indicate insertion
   mutations.

   Extract a unique set of co-ordinates for each residue. - Occasionally
   multiple sets of co-ordinates are given for a single atom or a whole
   residue. This must be distinguished from cases of heterogeneity.

   pdbparse parses every pdb file in a directory and writes a cleaned-up
   protein coordinate file in embl-like format for each one. The paths
   and extensions for the pdb (input) and protein coordinate (output)
   files are specified by the user. The user specifies whether the output
   files have the same names as the input files or whether the pdb
   identifier codes (from the pdb files) are used to name the files. A
   log file is also written.

Algorithm

   The PDB file is read into memory and the number of unique chains
   (covalently bonded, contiguous sequence of residues) and models
   (number of co-ordinate sets for a single chain) are assigned by
   reference to the PDB SEQRES and MODEL records respectively. The chain
   identifiers, molecule type, method used to derive the co-ordinates and
   the resolution of the structure (if applicable) are parsed.

   The procedure to determine the correct residue sequence and numbering
   for a chain relies on an alignment between sequences derived from the
   SEQRES and ATOM records of the PDB file ('SEQRES sequence' and 'ATOM
   sequence' are used hereon respectively) and is described in 5 steps as
   follows. (1) Each chain is pre-processed so that residue numbering is
   positive and incremental. Non-sequential or character-based numbering
   schemes are replaced, however any jumps in the residue numbering are
   preserved. The SEQRES sequence is corrected for any missing N-terminal
   ACE or MET residues. (2) A feature of PDB files is that the character
   position used to handle heterogeneity is the same as that used in
   character-based numbering schemes. Those residue positions displaying
   possible heterogeneity or using character-based numbering schemes are
   noted. (3) The parser attempts to align the SEQRES and ATOM sequences
   without allowing any errors (residue mismatches). At this stage, the
   file is presumed to use a character-based numbering scheme rather than
   contain heterogeneity.

   A quick check is made to see whether the ATOM sequence is a sub-string
   of the SEQRES sequence or if the residue numbering agrees with the
   SEQRES sequence. If no correspondence is found, sequence segments from
   the ATOM sequence are aligned (by string handling) to the SEQRES
   sequence.

   Overlapping sequence segments of progressively smaller size are used
   and gaps between successive alignments are allowed and in this manner
   missing residues in the ATOM records are detected. Consider a case
   where the first 50 residues of an ATOM sequence of 100 residues have
   been successfully aligned to residues 11-60 in the SEQRES sequence.
   The parser would search for an exact match using a sub-string of the
   ATOM sequence that was 50 residues long (positions 51 - 100), then 49
   residues (positions 51 - 99) and so on until an exact match for a
   single residue (position 51) was found. The sub-string could be
   matched to any region in the SEQRES sequence beginning from position
   61 onwards. (4) If after string alignment an exact match is not found
   for all positions, step 3 is repeated but heterogeneity is presumed
   rather than an alternative numbering scheme. (5) If an exact match
   cannot be found for all positions step 3 is repeated, but this time
   mismatches between the SEQRES and ATOM positions are allowed. The
   "true" residue is taken to be that in the ATOM records. For instance,
   in cases where the lengths of the two sequences are the same but the
   sequences differ, the sequence from the ATOM records is taken to be
   the true sequence.

   The co-ordinates for each chain of every model are then parsed.
   Co-ordinates for a chain are indicated by the presence of an ATOM or
   HETATM record before a TER record and containing the relevant chain
   identifier. For NMR structures, the model number is taken from a count
   of the MODEL records. In cases where multiple co-ordinates are given
   for a single atom or residue the first set of co-ordinates are taken.
   Co-ordinates for groups that are non co-valently associated with the
   protein ("heterogens") are parsed and, where possible, the group is
   assigned to a chain. Each group is assigned a group number that is
   relative to the chain or the protein (for groups that could not be
   associated with a chain). The HELIX, SHEET and TURN pdb records
   containing the crystallographers secondary structure element
   assignment are also parsed.

   Optionally the parser can be configured to (1) Mask non-amino acid
   groups in protein chains that do not contain a C-alpha atom. Masked
   residues will not appear in either the CO or SQ records of the clean
   coordinate file. (2) Mask amino acids in protein chains that do not
   contain a C-alpha atom. The amino acid will not appear in the CO
   record but will still be present in the SQ record of the clean
   coordinate file. (3) Mask amino acid residues in protein chains with a
   single atom only. The amino acid will appear not appear in the CO
   record but will still be present in the SQ record of the clean
   coordinate file.

Output file format

   pdbparse outputs a graph to the specified graphics device. outputs a
   report format file. The default format is ...

   [an error occurred while processing this directive]

   10 records are used in clean co-ordinate files as follows:

   (1) ID - the 4-character PDB identifier code (for domain co-ordinate
   files generated by domainer the 7-character domain identifier code
   taken from SCOP is given; see domainer.c.)

   (2) DE - compound information. Text from the COMPND records from the
   original PDB file is given.

   (3) OS - protein source information; text from the SOURCE records from
   the original PDB file.

   (4) EX - experimental information. The records are as follows (record
   names are given in parentheses): The text 'nmr_or_model' for nuclear
   magnetic resonance and model structures or 'xray' for structures
   determined by X-ray crystallography (METHOD). The resolution of X-ray
   structures, or '0' for structures of type 'nmr_or_model' (RESO). The
   number of models (NMOD) and number of polypeptide chains (NCHA). For
   domain co-ordinate files a 1 is always given. Number of groups
   ("heterogens") non co-valently associated with the protein but not
   assigned to a specific chain (NGRP). Following the EX record, the file
   will have a section containing a CN, IN and SQ records for each chain.

   (5) CN - chain number. The number given in brackets indicates the
   start of a section of chain- specific data.

   (6) IN - chain specific data: The PDB chain identifier (ID, a '.' is
   given in cases where a chain identifier was not specified in the PDB
   file or (a '.' is given in domain co-ordinate files where the domain
   is comprised of more than one domain). The number of amino acid
   residues comprising the chain, or domain for domain coordinate files
   (NR). The number of groups ("heterogens") which are non-covalently
   associated with the chain, excluding water (NL). Domain co-ordinate
   files do not include co-ordinates for these groups so a value of 0 is
   always given. The number of helices (NH) or beta-strands (NE) in the
   chain or domain.

   (7) SQ - protein sequence. The number of residues is given before AA
   on the first line. The protein sequence is given on subsequent lines.

   (8) CO - co-ordinate data. The records are as follows (column numbers
   are given in parentheses): (i) CO is always given. (ii) Model number
   (always 1 for domain co-ordinate files). (iii) Chain number (always 1
   for domain co-ordinate files). (iv) Group number (for heterogens). (v)
   Either P (a protein atom), H (a heterogen atom) or W (an atom in a
   water molecule). (vi) Position of the residue in the protein sequence
   given in the SQ record (for protein atoms) or '.' (for heterogens and
   water). (vii) Residue number according to the original PDB file.
   (viii) Secondary structure element type, either 'C' (coil), 'H'
   (helix), 'E' (beta-strand) or 'T' (turn) taken from the PDB file. (ix)
   Secondary structure element serial number corresponding to columns 8 -
   10 in a HELIX, SHEET or TURN record of a pdb file, or '.' for atoms
   that do not occur in a helix or sheet. (x) Secondary structure element
   identifier code corresponding to columns 12 - 14 in a HELIX, SHEET or
   TURN record of a pdb file, or '.' for atoms that do not occur in a
   helix or sheet. (xi) The class of helix, which is an integer from
   1-10; 1 - right-handed alpha, 2 - right-handed omega, 3 - right-handed
   pi, 4 - right-handed gamma, 5 - right-handed 3-10, 6 - left-handed
   alpha, 7 - left-handed omega, 8 - left-handed gamma, 9 - 27
   ribbon/helix or 10 - polyproline, see
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html.
   (xii) Secondary structure assignment according to STRIDE, one of 'H'
   (Alpha helix), 'G' (3-10 helix), 'I' (PI-helix), 'E' (Extended
   conformation), 'B' or 'b' (Isolated bridge), 'T' (Turn) or 'C' (Coil,
   none of the above). These data are added to the coordinate file by
   using pdbplus and a '.' will be given for this record in files that
   have not been processed by pdbplus. (xiii) Secondary structure element
   number extracted from stride assignment. An 'element' is defined as a
   run of a user-defined number of residues in the 'H', 'G' or 'I'
   conformation (helical element) or the 'E' conformation (beta strand
   element). Again, a '.' will be given if the file has not been
   processed by pdbplus. (xiv) Single character amino acid code or a '.'
   (for heterogens and water). (xv) 3-character residue identifier code.
   (xvi) Atom type. (xvii-xix) The x, y and z orthogonal co-ordinates.
   (xx) Occupancy. (xxi) Temperature factor. (xxii-xxiv) Phi and Psi
   angle and solvent accessible surface area of residue as calculated by
   stride. These data are added to the coordinate file by using pdbplus
   and will have the value of zero in files that have not been processed
   by pdbplus. (xxv-xxxv) Accessible surface area according to NACCESS.
   These data are added to the coordinate file by using pdbplus and will
   have the value of zero in files that have not been processed by
   pdbplus. Absolute and relative measures of residue accessible surface
   area are given. The absolute accessibility of a residue is the summed
   accessible surface of the atoms in an amino acid residue, whereas the
   relative accessibility is expressed as a percentage relative to the
   accessibility of the residue in an extended ALA-x-ALA tripeptide. The
   meaning of the colums are (xxv) absolute accessibility of all atoms,
   (xxvi) relative accessibility of all atoms, (xxxvii) absolute
   accessibility of all side-chain atoms, (xxxviii) relative
   accessibility of all side-chain atoms, (xxxix) absolute accessibility
   of all main-chain atoms, (xxxx) relative accessibility of all
   main-chain atoms, (xxxxi) absolute accessibility of all non-polar
   side-chain atoms, (xxxxii) relative accessibility of all non-polar
   side-chain atoms, (xxxxiii) absolute accessibility of all polar
   side-chain atoms, (xxxxiv) relative accessibility of all polar
   side-chain atoms. The NACCESS authors treat alpha carbons as sidechain
   atoms so that glycine can have a sidechain accessibility. They are
   therefore not included in the mainchain.

   (9) XX - Used for spacing.

   (10) // - Given on the last line of the file only.

Notes

   Records in the clean coordinate file for the number of helices (NH) or
   beta-strands (NE) in a chain and several columns (see 'Output file
   format' below) of the coordinate line record (CO) are written by
   pdbparse but will have the value of 0. The program pdbplus can be used
   to assign values to these records.

Warnings

   pdbparse is not guaranteed to work correctly (or even at all) for
   files where an NMR structure contains multiple models but the models
   have different sequence of residues due to errors.

   pdbparse will not work in cases where a residue number is duplicated
   AND an alternative residue numbering system is used somewhere else in
   the same chain. If such cases exist they could be parsed by having a
   variable corresponding to oddnum, but just for duplicate residue
   positions. The new variable would get written in the same place as
   oddnum is written.

   The author does not know whether either of the above cases occur in
   pdb.

   pdbparse necessarily must hold the entire pdb file and some derived
   data in memory. If an error of the type 'Uncaught exception:
   Allocation failed, insufficient memory available' is raised then this
   is probably because the memory requirements exceed per-user memory
   defaults (that are usually set quite low). This can easily be
   unlimited by the sysop in the login process. If tcsh is used, then
   simply type 'unlimit' before pdbparse is run.
