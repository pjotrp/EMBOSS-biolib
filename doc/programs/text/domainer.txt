Description

   This program is part of a suite of EMBOSS applications that directly
   or indirectly make use of the protein structure databases pdb and
   scop. This program is part of an experimental analysis pipeline
   described in an accompanying document. We provide the software in the
   hope that it will be useful. The applications were designed for
   specific research purposes and may not be useful or reliable in
   contexts other than the described pipeline. The development of the
   suite was coordinated by Jon Ison to whom enquiries and bug reports
   should be sent (email jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   There is a need for a convenient source of protein coordinate data
   which includes protein strucutral domain definitions and is therefore
   appropriate for domain-centred approaches. domainer reads protein
   coordinate files and writes files of coordinate data for individual
   scop domains in embl-like and pdb formats.

   domainer reads a scop classification file and a directory of protein
   coordinate files and writes, for each domain in the scop
   classification file, domain coordinate files in embl-like and pdb
   formats. Each domain coordinate file contains coordinates for a single
   scop domain. The paths and extensions for the protein (input) and
   domain (output) coordinate files are specified by the user. The scop
   domain identifier codes are used to name the output files. A log file
   for each of the embl-like and pdb format builds is written.

Algorithm

   All domainer does is read a clean coordinate file for the full length
   protein and, using the domain definition given in a scop
   classification file, write a clean coordinate file just containing the
   coordinates for the domain. The 'algorithm' is trivial; just reading
   stuff to and from data structures.

   The scop classification file gives the pdb residue numbers of the
   first and last residue of the segment(s) of the chain comprising the
   domain. Coordinate and sequence data corresponding to these region(s)
   only are written to the output file.

Input file format

   domainer reads any normal sequence USAs.

   The format of the protein coordinate file is described in pdbparse

Output file format

   The embl-like format used for domain coordinate files is exactly the
   same as that used for protein coordinate files and is described in
   pdbparse.

   An excerpt of the pdb format used for domain coordinate files is shown
   below. pdb format is explained on the pdb website:

   (1)
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html
   domainer writes the following records in pdb format (Figure 1):

   (1) HEADER - bibliographic information. The text 'CLEANED-UP PDB FILE
   FOR SCOP DOMAIN XXXXXXX' is always given (where XXXXXXX is a
   7-character domain identifier code).

   (2) TITLE - bibliographic information. The text ' THIS FILE IS MISSING
   MOST RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PDB FILE' is always given.

   (3) COMPND - compound information. The COMPND records from the
   original pdb file are given.

   (4) SOURCE - protein source information. The SOURCE records from the
   original pdb file are given.

   (5) REMARK - remark records. Remark records are used for spacing. One
   REMARK line containing the protein resolution is always given.

   (6) SEQRES - protein sequence.

   (7) ATOM - atomic coordinates.

   (8) TER - indicates the end of a chain.**

Notes

   Where coordinates for multiple models are given in a protein
   coordinate file, the domain coordinate file will contain coordinates
   for the first model.

   In the rare cases where a domain is comprised of segments from more
   than one chain, the data in the domain coordinate file will be
   presented as belonging to a single chain with a chain identifier of
   '.'. A single sequence will be given

   The start and end positions of domains in scop coincide in several
   cases to residues which either lack a CA atom or for which coordinates
   for a single atom only are given in the pdb file. To ensure these
   domains are processed during a domainer run, it is important to use
   clean protein coordinate files which have NOT been masked to remove
   such residues. Otherwise errors of the following type may occur in the
   log file:

//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain end not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain
**
//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain start not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   domainer generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown below. If
   there is a problem in processing a domain, three lines containing the
   record '//', the domain identifier code and an error message
   respectively are written. The text 'WARN filename not found' is given
   in cases where a clean coordinate file could not be found. 'ERROR
   filename file read error' or 'ERROR filename file write error' will be
   reported when an error was encountered during a file read or write
   respectively. The 'ERROR Domain start found by wildcard match only' is
   reported when wildcard matching was needed to find the start (or end)
   of a domain in a pdb file (see below). Various other error messages
   may also be given (in case of difficulty email Jon Ison,
   jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   Excerpt of log file

//
DS002__
WARN  Could not open for reading cpdb file s002.pxyz
//
DS003__
WARN  Could not open for reading cpdb file s003.pxyz

   Messages of the type:

//
D0LPC_1
WARN  0lpc.pxyz not found

   can appear in the log file if

   (i) The domain is of a pdb file which is in holding, but has not made
   it into the main pdb release yet.

   (ii) The domain is of a pdb file that is now obsolete - having been
   replaced by a more recent entry.

   There may be other cases too.

   Messages of the type:

//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain start not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain
//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain end not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain
indicate that residues for the start or end of a domain are missing from
the protein coordinate file (see 'Notes' above).

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None. [an error occurred while processing this directive]

   A 'scop classification file' contains classification and other data
   for domains from the scop database. The file is in embl-like format
   and is generated by scopparse. Domain sequence information can be
   added to the file by using scopseqs.

   A 'protein coordinate file' contains protein coordinate and other data
   extracted from a single pdb file. The files, generated by pdbparse,
   are in embl-like format and contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
   self-consistent and error-corrected.

   pdbplus, scopreso, scopseqs, scopalign and siggen use domain
   coordinate files as input.
