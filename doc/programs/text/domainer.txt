1.0 SUMMARY

   Reads CCF files (clean coordinate files) for proteins and writes CCF
   files for domains, taken from a DCF file (domain classification file).

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINER reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and a directory
   of protein CCF files (clean coordinate files) and writes, for each
   domain in the DCF file, a domain CCF file and domain PDB file. Each
   domain CCF file contains coordinates for a single SCOP domain. The
   paths and extensions for the protein (input) and domain (output)
   coordinate files are specified by the user (path) and in the ACD file
   (extension). The SCOP domain identifier codes are used to name the
   output files. A log file for each of the DCF and PDB format builds is
   written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the protein CCF file is described in the PDBPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format used for domain CCF files is exactly the same as that used
   for protein CCF files and is described the PDBPARSE documentation.
   An excerpt of the PDB format used for domain CCF files is shown below.
   PDB format is explained on the PDB website:
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html
   DOMAINER writes the following records in PDB format (Figure 1):
   (1) HEADER - bibliographic information. The text 'CLEANED-UP PDB FILE
   FOR SCOP DOMAIN XXXXXXX' is always given (where XXXXXXX is a
   7-character domain identifier code).
   (2) TITLE - bibliographic information. The text ' THIS FILE IS MISSING
   MOST RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PDB FILE' is always given.
   (3) COMPND - compound information. The COMPND records from the
   original PDB file are given.
   (4) SOURCE - protein source information. The SOURCE records from the
   original PDB file are given.
   (5) REMARK - remark records. Remark records are used for spacing. One
   REMARK line containing the protein resolution is always given.
   (6) SEQRES - protein sequence.
   (7) ATOM - atomic coordinates.
   (8) TER - indicates the end of a chain.

   Protein clean coordinate files were read from test_data/.
   Domain definitions were taken from test_data/all.scop and domain clean
   coordinate files and domain PDB files were written.
   Three file extensions for protein coordinate input files (e.g.
   1cs4.ccf and 1ii7.ccf), domain coordinate files in CCF format (e.g.
   d1cs4a_.ccf and d1ii7a_.ccf) and PDB formats (e.g. d1cs4a_.ent and
   d1ii7a_.ent) will have been set in the ACD file.
   Log files called domainer_embl.log and domainer_pdb.log were written.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.
domainer test_data/ test_data/domainer test_data/domainer -scop

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   Wildcard matching of SCOP domain start and end points
   SCOP treats PDB residue numbers as integers and this is a potential
   source of error in the domain ranges. It means that DOMAINER (via
   library calls) must use wild card strings when matching a SCOP start /
   end point to the PDB residue number strings.

8.0 NOTES

   Where coordinates for multiple models are given in a protein
   coordinate file, the domain CCF file will contain coordinates for the
   first model.
   In the rare cases where a domain is comprised of segments from more
   than one chain, the data in the domain CCF file will be presented as
   belonging to a single chain with a chain identifier of '.'. A single
   sequence will be given.
   The start and end positions of domains in SCOP coincide in several
   cases to residues which either lack a CA atom or for which coordinates
   for a single atom only are given in the PDB file. To ensure these
   domains are processed during a DOMAINER run, it is important to use
   protein CCF files which have NOT been masked to remove such residues.
   Otherwise errors of the following type may occur in the log file:
//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain end not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain

//
D1QFUL1
ERROR Domain start not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   DOMAINER fills the need for a convenient source of protein coordinate
   data which includes protein strucutral domain definitions and is
   therefore appropriate for domain-centred approaches. DOMAINER reads
   protein CCF files and writes files of coordinate data for individual
   SCOP domains in clean and PDB formats. Domain definitions are taken
   from a DCF file (domain classification file). For example, SCOPPARSE
   parses the raw SCOP classification files (dir.cla.scop.txt and
   dir.des.scop.txt) available at URL
   (http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/parse/) and generate a DCF output
   file suitable for use with DOMAINER.

10.0 ALGORITHM

   We wrote the DOMAINER application to read protein CCF files and
   generate files of coordinates for single SCOP domains in the "clean"
   format (domain CCF files, Figure 1) and the PDB format. DOMAINER reads
   a file of domain classification data (e.g. prepared by using the
   application SCOPPARSE or CATHPARSE), and generates a domain CCF and
   domain PDB file for each domain listed. Where coordinates for multiple
   models were determined, data in the output files are given for the
   first model only. In cases where a domain consists of sections from
   more than one polypeptide chain, the data are presented as belonging
   to a single chain only (a single sequence with a chain identifier of
   is given).

   files) for proteins.

   files (contact files) of inter-chain residue-residue contact data.

   (domain classification file).

12.0 DIAGNOSTIC ERROR MESSAGES

   DOMAINER generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown (Figure 2).
   If there is a problem in processing a domain, three lines containing
   the record '//', the domain identifier code and an error message
   respectively are written. The following messages may then be given.
   WARN filename not found (A CCF file could not be found).
   ERROR filename file read error (An error was encountered during a file
   read or write respectively.)
   ERROR filename file write error (An error was encountered during a
   file read or write respectively.)
   ERROR Domain start found by wildcard match only (Wildcard matching was
   needed to find the start (or end) of a domain in a PDB file: see
   below).
   Various other error messages may also be given (in case of difficulty
   email Jon Ison, jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
   Figure 2 Excerpt of log file
//
DS002__
WARN  Could not open for reading cpdb file s002.pxyz
//
DS003__
WARN  Could not open for reading cpdb file s003.pxyz

   Messages of the type below can appear in the log file if (i) The
   domain is of a PDB file which is in holding, but has not made it into
   the main PDB release yet. (ii) The domain is of a PDB file that is now
   obsolete - having been replaced by a more recent entry. There may be
   other cases too.
//
D0LPC_1
WARN  0lpc.pxyz not found

   Messages of the type below indicate that residues for the start or end
   of a domain are missing from the protein CCF file (see 'Notes' above).
//

ERROR Domain start not found in ajXyzCpdbWriteDomain
//
