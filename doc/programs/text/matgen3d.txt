   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -mode               menu       This option specifies the amino acid residue
                                  positions to use in calculating the
                                  substitution data.
*  -model              menu       This option specifies whether to use all
                                  ligands or a specific set of ligands present
                                  in a CON file when calculating the
                                  substitution data.
*  -dcfinfile          infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
*  -coninfile          infile     This option specifies the location of CON
                                  files (contact files) (output). A 'contact
                                  file' contains contact data for a protein or
                                  a domain from SCOP or CATH, in the CON
                                  format (EMBL-like). The contacts may be
                                  intra-chain residue-residue, inter-chain
                                  residue-residue or residue-ligand. The files
                                  are generated by using CONTACTS, INTERFACE
                                  and SITES.

                                  identifier codes. One id code should be
                                  given per line.
  [-ccfddir]           directory  This option specifies the location of CCF

                                  coordinate and derived data for a single PDB

                                  (EMBL-like). The files, generated by using

                                  contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected. Records
                                  for residue solvent accessibility and
                                  secondary structure are added to the file by

                                  file ('protein clean coordinate file') or a
                                  single domain from SCOP or CATH ('domain
                                  clean coordinate file'), in CCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files, generated by using
                                  PDBPARSE (PDB files) or DOMAINER (domains),
