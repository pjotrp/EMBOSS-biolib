1.0 SUMMARY

   Reorder DCF file (domain classification file) so that the
   representative structure of each user-specified node is given first.

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINREP reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a
   DCF file containing the same data except that the order of domains
   within each user-specified node (e.g. family) in the hierarchy may be
   changed so that the representative structure of each node is given
   first. The representative structure is found by using stamp and this
   application must be installed on the system that is running DOMAINREP
   and correctly configured (see 'Notes' below). A 'domain PDB file' for
   each domain in the DCF file must exist in a directory specified in the
   stamp "pdb.directories" file (see 'Notes' below). The domain PDB file
   contains coordinate data for a single domain from SCOP or CATH, in PDB
   format. The input and output files are specified by the user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.

5.0 DATA FILES

   DOMAINREP does not use any data files but does make use of the stamp
   "pdb.directories" file (see 'Notes').

6.0 USAGE

  6.1 COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-scopin]            infile     A 'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -node               menu       Reordering can be done for any specified
                                  node in the SCOP or CATH hierarchies. For
                                  example by selecting 'Class' entries
                                  belonging to the same Class will be
                                  reordered in turn.
  [-scopout]           outfile    A 'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.

  6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION

   An example of interactive use of DOMAINREP is shown below.

Unix % domainrep
Reorder DCF file (domain classification file) so that the representative
structure of each user-specified node is given first.
Name of DCF file (domain classification file) for input (DCF format): testdata/
all.scop
Node at which to reorder file
         1 : Class (SCOP)
         2 : Fold (SCOP)
         3 : Superfamily (SCOP)
         4 : Family (SCOP)
         5 : Class (CATH)
         6 : Architecture (CATH)
         7 : Topology (CATH)
         8 : Homologous Superfamily (CATH)
         9 : Family (CATH)
Select number [1]: 4
Name of DCF file (domain classification file) for output (DCF format). [test.sc
op]: testdata/all_rep1st.scop
Unix %

   The DCF file /test_data/all.scop was read and the DCF file
   /test_data/all_rep1st.scop was written in which the order of domains
   for each family was changed if necessary so that the representative
   structure of each family is given first.
   The following command line would achieve the same result.


domainrep testdata/all.scop testdata/all_rep1st.scop -node 4

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   None.

8.0 NOTES

   stamp modification
   DOMAINREP will only run with with a version of stamp which has been
   modified so that PDB id codes of length greater than 4 characters are
   acceptable. This involves a trivial change to the stamp module
   getdomain.c (around line number 155), a 4 must be changed to a 7 as
   follows:

temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,4,OUTPUT);
< change to ... >
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,7,OUTPUT);

   stamp configuration
   stamp searches for pdb files with a certain prefix, extension and path
   as specified in the stamp "pdb.directories" file, which should look
   like something like this (change the text according to your system
   setup):

/data/pdb - -
/data/pdb _ .ent
/data/pdb _ .pdb
/data/pdb pdb .ent
/data/pdbscop _ _
/data/pdbscop _ .ent
/data/pdbscop _ .pdb
/data/pdbscop pdb .ent
./ _ _
./ _ .ent
./ _ .ent.z
./ _ .ent.gz
./ _ .pdb
./ _ .pdb.Z
./ _ .pdb.gz
./ pdb .ent
./ pdb .ent.Z
./ pdb .ent.gz
/data/CASS1/pdb/coords/ _ .pdb
/data/CASS1/pdb/coords/ _ .pdb.Z
/data/CASS1/pdb/coords/ _ .pdb.gz

   RFCGR Users
   For users of the RFCGR computer systems, the modified stamp code is
   kept in /packages/stamp/src2. When running DOMAINREP at the RFCGR it
   is essential that the command 'use stamp2' (which runs the script
   /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) is given before DOMAINREP is run. This will
   ensure that the modified version of stamp is used. For RFCGR users,
   the pdb.directories file is /packages/stamp/defs/pdb.directories.
   Domain PDB files (pdb format) for SCOP domains are stored in
   /data/pdbscop.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   The protein structural alignment program stamp aligns multiple
   structures to a seed structure. The best alignments will result when
   the seed is the best available representative of the entire set, i.e.
   in structural terms, is more similar to the other structures than any
   other structure.
   DOMAINALIGN calls stamp to generate alignments of domains belonging to
   the same node (e.g. family) in a DCF file. DOMAINALIGN will produce
   better alignments if the DCF file is reordered so that the
   representative structure of each node is given first, because the
   first strucutres are used as the seeds. The reordering of the DCF file
   is done by using DOMAINREP.
