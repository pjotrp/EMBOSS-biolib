1.0 SUMMARY

   Generates DCF file from raw CATH files

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   CATHPARSE parses the CATH classification files, e.g. caths.list.v2.4,
   domlist.v2.4 and CAT.names.all.v2.4. These files are available by
   anonymous ftp from ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk (e.g. /pub/cathdata/v2.4) The
   format of these files is explained in the README file available there.
   CATHPARSE writes the CATH classification to a DCF file (EMBL-like
   format). No changes are made to the data other than changing the format
   in which it is held. The input and output files are specified by the
   user.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   An excerpt from the raw CATH classification files, of the type
   caths.list.vX.X (Figure 1), domlist.vX.X (Figure 2) and
   CAT.names.all.vX.X (Figure 3) is shown below. The format of these files
   is explained in the CATH README file available by anonymous ftp from
   ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk (e.g. /pub/cathdata/v2.4).

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   An example of the DCF output file is shown in Figure 4. The records
   used to describe an entry are as follows. Records (5) to (8) are used
   to describe the position of the domain in the CATH hierarchy.
     * (1) ID - Domain identifier code. This is a 6-character code that
       uniquely identifies the domain in CATH. The first four characters
       are the PDB identifier code, the fifth character is the PDB chain
       identifier to which the domain belongs and the final character is
       the number of the domain in the chain (for chains comprising more
       than one domain). This character is '0' if the chain comprises a
       single domain only.
     * (2) EN - PDB identifier code. This is the 4-character PDB
       identifier code of the PDB entry containing the domain.
     * (3) TY - domain type. "CATH" or "SCOP" is given ("CATH" for DCF
       files generated by using CATHPARSE).
     * (4) CI - CATH Classification Numbers. The integers preceeding the
       codes CL, AR, TP, SF, FA, NI, IF are the CATH classification
       numbers for CLass, ARchitecture, ToPology, Homologous SuPerfamily,
       FAmily, Near Identical family and Identical Family respectively.
       These numbers uniquely identify the appropriate node in the CATH
       parsable files.
     * (5) CL - Class. It is the identical text taken from
       CAT.names.all.vX.X.
     * (6) AR - Architecture. It is the identical text taken from
       CAT.names.all.vX.X.
     * (7) TP - Topology. It is the identical text taken from
       CAT.names.all.vX.X.
     * (8) SF - Homologous Superfamily. It is the identical text taken
       from CAT.names.all.vX.X.
     * (9) DS - Sequence of the domain according to the PDB file. This
       sequence is taken from the domain CCF file (clean coordinate file)
       generated by DOMAINER. The DS record will only be present if the
       DCF file has been processed using DOMAINSEQS.
     * (10) NR - Number of residues in domain
     * (11) NC - Number of segments comprising the domain. All domains in
       CATH are from single chains. If the number of segments is greater
       than 1, then the domain entry will have a section containing a CN
       and a CH record (see below) for each segment.
     * (12) CN - Segment number. The number given in brackets after this
       record indicates the start of the data for the relevent segment.
     * (13) CH - Domain definition. The character given before CHAIN is
       the PDB chain identifier, the strings before START and END give the
       start and end positions respectively of the domain in the PDB file
       (a '.' is given in cases where a position was not specified). Note
       that the start and end positions refer to residue numbering given
       in the original pdb file and therefore must be treated as strings.
       (14) XX - used for spacing. (15) // - used to delimit records for a
       domain.
