EMBASSY MEME is a suite of application wrappers to the original meme v3.0.14 applications written by  Timothy Bailey. meme v3.0.14 must be installed on the same system as EMBOSS and the location of the meme executables must be defined in your path for EMBASSY MEME to work.

<p><b>Usage:</b>
<br>ememe [options] mfile outfile
<p>The outfile parameter is new to EMBASSY MEME. The output is always written to <outfile>. 

<p>  MAST: Motif Alignment and Search Tool
  
<p>  MAST is a tool for searching biological sequence databases for sequences
  that contain one or more of a group of known motifs. 
  
<p>  A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related
  protein or DNA sequences. Motifs are represented as position-dependent
  scoring matrices that describe the score of each possible letter at each
  position in the pattern. Individual motifs may not contain gaps. Patterns with
  variable-length gaps must be split into two or more separate motifs before
  being submitted as input to MAST. 
  
<p>  MAST takes as input a file containing the descriptions of one or more motifs
  and searches a sequence database that you select for sequences that match
  the motifs. The motif file can be the output of the MEME motif discovery tool 
  or any file in the appropriate format. 
  
<p>  MAST outputs three things: 
<ul>  
<li>    1. The names of the high-scoring sequences sorted by the strength of the
       combined match of the sequence to all of the motifs in the group. 
<li>    2. Motif diagrams showing the order and spacing of the motifs within each
       matching sequence. 
<li>    3. Detailed annotation of each matching sequence showing the sequence
       and the locations and strengths of matches to the motifs. 
</ul>
  
<p>  MAST works by calculating match scores for each sequence in the database
  compared with each of the motifs in the group of motifs you provide. For each
  sequence, the match scores are converted into various types of p-values and
  these are used to determine the overall match of the sequence to the group of
  motifs and the probable order and spacing of occurrences of the motifs in the
  sequence.

    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.

<!--#include file="inc/emast.usage" -->



<h3>  EXAMPLES:</h3>
<p><b>Please note</b> the examples below are unedited excerpts of the original MEME documentation.  Bear in mind the EMBASSY and original MEME options may differ in practice (see "1. Command-line arguments").
  
<p>  The following examples assume that file "meme.results" is the
  output of a MEME run containing at least 3 motifs and file
  SwissProt is a copy of the Swiss-Prot database on your local disk.
  DNA_DB is a copy of a DNA database on your local disk.
   
<p>  1) Annotate the training set: 
<br>  	mast meme.results
   
<p>  2) Find sequences matching the motif and annotate them in the SwissProt database:</b>
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt
   
<p>  3) Show sequences with weaker combined matches to motifs.</b>
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt -ev 200
   
<p>  4) Indicate weaker matches to single motifs in the annotation so that sequences with weak matches to the motifs (but perhaps with the "correct" order and spacing) can be seen:
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt -w
   
<p>  5) Include a nominal order and spacing of the first three motifs in the calculation of the sequence p-values to increase the sensitivity of the search for matching sequences:
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt -diag "9-[2]-61-[1]-62-[3]-91"
   
<p>  6) Use only the first and third motifs in the search:
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt -m 1 -m 3
   
<p>  7) Use only the first two motifs in the search:
<br>  	mast meme.results -d SwissProt -c 2
  
<p>  8) Search DNA sequences using protein motifs, adjusting p-values and E-values for each sequence by that sequence's composition:
<br> 	mast meme.results -d DNA_DB -dna -comp



<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
Where possible, the same command-line qualifier names and parameter order is used as in the original mast. There are however several unavoidable differences and these are clearly documented in the "Notes" section below.

<p>Most of the options in the original mast are given in ACD as "advanced" or
"additional" options. -options must be specified on the command-line in order 
to be prompted for a value for "additional" options but "advanced" options 
will never be prompted for.  

<p> Please note that one only of -stdin or -d should be specified.  If you set both, then -d will be used.   This behaviour could have been enforced at the level of the ACD file by using an ACD select: or list: type but this would have been inconsistent with the original meme, which has two separate options.

<h3>  MOTIF FORMAT  </h3>
  
  MAST can search using (multiple) motifs contained in 
<ul>  
<li>      a MEME output file, 
<li>      a GCG profile file, 
<li>      two or more GCG profile filess concatenated together, or 
<li>      a file with the following format. 
</ul>  

<h3>                    Motif file format </h3>
<pre>  
       ALPHABET= alphabet
       log-odds matrix: alength= alength w= w
       row_1
       row_2
       ...
       row_w  
</pre>  
  
  
<p>      A motif is represented by a position-dependent scoring matrix. 
<p>      A scoring matrix is preceded by a line starting with the words
      log-odds matrix: and specifying alength, the length of
      the alphabet (number of columns in the scoring matrix), and the w, the
      width of the motif (number of rows in the scoring matrix). 
<p>      The following w lines (no blank lines allowed) contain the rows of the
      scoring matrix. Row i, column j of the matrix gives the score for the j-th
      letter in alphabet appearing at position i in an occurrence of the
      motif. 

<p>      The spaces after the equals signs and the colon are required. 
<p>      The number of letters in alphabet must equal alength. 
<p>      Any number of additional motifs may follow the first one. 
<p>      The motif file must contain a line starting with 
  <pre>
              ALPHABET= 
</pre>  
      followed by alphabet, a list containing the letters used in the motifs. 

<p>      The order of the letters in alphabet must be the same as the order of the
      columns of scores in the motifs. The order need not be alphabetical
      and case does not matter, but there should be no spaces in alphabet.
<p>      The letters in alphabet must be a subset of either the IUB/IUPAC DNA
      (ABCDGHKMNRSTUVWY) or protein
      (ABCDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ) alphabets. DNA alphabets
      must contain at least the letters ACGT. Protein alphabets must contain
      at least the letters ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY. All other letters in
      the alphabets are optional. If any of the optional letters are missing 
      from alphabet, MAST automatically generates scores for them by taking the
      weighted average of the scores for the letters which the missing letter
      could match. (The weights are the frequencies of the replaced letters in
      the appropriate non-redundant database.) Replacements for the
      optional letters are given in the following table.

<h3>    Match Scores <h3>
  
  The match score of a motif to a position in a sequence is the sum of the
  score from each column of the position-dependent scoring matrix
  corresponding to the letter at that position in the sequence. For example, if
  the sequence is 

<pre>  
  TAATGTTGGTGCTGGTTTTTGTGGCATCGGGCGAGAATAGCGC
     ========
 </pre>

  and the motif is represented by the position-dependent scoring matrix (where
  each row of the matrix corresponds to a position in the motif) 

<pre>  
  =========|=================================
  POSITION |   A        C        G        T
  =========|=================================
    1      | 1.447    0.188   -4.025   -4.095 
    2      | 0.739    1.339   -3.945   -2.325 
    3      | 1.764   -3.562   -4.197   -3.895 
    4      | 1.574   -3.784   -1.594   -1.994 
    5      | 1.602   -3.935   -4.054   -1.370 
    6      | 0.797   -3.647   -0.814    0.215 
    7      |-1.280    1.873   -0.607   -1.933 
    8      |-3.076    1.035    1.414   -3.913 
  =========|=================================
</pre>  

  then the match score of the fourth position in the sequence (underlined)
  would be found by summing the score for T in position 1, G in position 2 and
  so on until G in position 8. So the match score would be 
  
<pre>
    score = -4.095 + -3.945 + -3.895 + -1.994
            + -4.054 + -0.814 + -1.933 + 1.414 
          = -19.316
  </pre>
  The match scores for other positions in the sequence are calculated in the
  same way. Match scores are only calculated if the match completely fits within
  the sequence. Match scores are not calculated if the motif would overhang
  either end of the sequence. 
  
<h3>    P-values </h3>
  
  MAST reports all matches of a sequence to a motif or group of motifs in terms
  of the p-value of the match. MAST considers the p-values of four types of
  events: 
<ul>
<li>  position p-value: the match of a single position within a sequence to
      	a given motif, 
<li>      sequence p-value: the best match of any position within a sequence
      	to a given motif, 
<li>      combined p-value: the combined best matches of a sequence to a
      	group of motifs, and 
<li>      E-value: observing a combined p-value at least as small in a random
      	database of the same size. 
</ul>
  
  All p-values are based on a random sequence model that assumes each
  position in a random sequence is generated according to the average letter
  frequencies of all sequences in the the appropriate (peptide or nucleotide)
  non-redundant database (ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/) on September 22,
  1996.  This can be overridden in two ways:
  
<h3>  	1) -bfile < bfile > </h3>
  	The random model uses the letter frequencies given in < bfile > 
  	instead of the non-redundant database frequencies.
  	The format of < bfile > is the same as that for the MEME -bfile opton; 
  	see the MEME documentation for details.  Sample files are given in 
  	directory tests: tests/nt.freq and tests/na.freq.) 
  	
<h3>  	2) -comp </h3>
  	The random model uses the letter frequencies in the current target
  	sequence instead of the non-redundant database frequencies.  This
  	causes p-values and E-values to be compensated individually for the 
  	actual composition of each sequence in the database.  This option
  	can increase search time substantially due to the need to compute
  	a different score distribution for each high-scoring sequence.
  
  
<h3>      Position p-value </h3>
  
      The p-value of a match of a given position within a sequence to a
      motif is defined as the probability of a randomly selected position in a
      randomly generated sequence having a match score at least as large
      as that of the given position. 
  
<h3>      Sequence p-value </h3>
  
      The p-value of a match of a sequence to a motif is defined as the
      probability of a randomly generated sequence of the same length
      having a match score at least as large as the largest match score of
      any position in the sequence. 
  
<h3>      Combined p-value </h3>
  
      The p-value of a match of a sequence to a group of motifs is defined
      as the probability of a randomly generated sequence of the same
      length having sequence p-values whose product is at least as small
      as the product of the sequence p-values of the matches of the motifs
      to the given sequence. 
  
<h3>      E-value </h3>
  
      The E-value of the match of a sequence in a database to a a group
      of motifs is defined as the expected number of sequences in a random
      database of the same size that would match the motifs as well as the
      sequence does and is equal to the combined p-value of the sequence
      times the number of sequences in the database. 
  
<h3>    High-scoring Sequences </h3>
  
  MAST lists the names and part of the descriptive text of all sequences
  whose E-value is less than E. Sequences shorter than one or more of the
  motifs are skipped. The sequences are sorted by increasing E-value. The
  value of E is set to 10 for the WEB server but is user-selectable in the
  down-loadable version of MAST. 
  
<h3>    Motif Diagrams </h3>
  
  Motif diagrams show the order and spacing of non-overlapping matches to
  the motifs in each high-scoring sequence. Motif occurrences are determined
  based on the position p-value of matches to the motif. Strong matches
  (p-value < M) are shown in square brackets (`[ ]'), weak matches (M <
  p-value < M × 10) are shown in angle brackets (`< >') and the length of
  non-motif sequence ("spacer") is shown between dashes (`-'). For example, 
<pre>  
          27-[3]-44-< 4 >-99-[1]-7
</pre>  
  shows an initial spacer of length 27, followed by a strong match to motif 3, a
  spacer of length 44, a weak match to motif 4, a spacer of length 99, a strong
  match to motif 1 and a final non-motif sequence of length 7. The value of M is
  0.0001 for the WEB server but is user-selectable in the down-loadable
  version of MAST. 
  
<p>
  Note: If you specify the -hit_list switch to MAST, the motif "diagram" takes the form
  of a comma separated list of motif occurrences ("hits").  Each "hit" has the format:
  	< strand >< motif > < start > < end > < p-value >
  where 
<ul>
<li>          < strand >        is the strand (+ or - for DNA, blank for protein),
<li>          < motif >         is the motif number,
<li>          < start >         is the starting position of the hit,
<li>          < end >           is the ending position of the hit, and
<li>          < p-value >       is the position p-value of the hit.
</ul>  


<h3>    Annotated Sequences </h3>
  
  MAST annotates each high-scoring sequence by printing the sequence
  along with the position and strength of all the non-overlapping motif
  occurrences. The four lines above each motif occurrence contain,
  respectively, 
<ul>  
<li>      the motif number of the occurrence, 
<li>      the position p-value of the occurence, 
<li>      the best possible match to the motif, and 
<li>      a plus sign (`+') above each letter in the occurrence that has a positive
<li>      match score to the motif. 
</ul>  
  The best possible match to a motif is the sequence of letters which would
  acheive the highest match score.
