1.0 SUMMARY

   Generate residue-ligand CON files from CCF files

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   SITES reads CCF files (clean coordinate file) and writes a CON files
   (contacts file) of residue-ligand contact data for domains in a DCF
   file (domain classification file). The CON file contains contact data
   for all ligand-domain pairs (using domain definitions from the DCF
   file) found in the CCF files. The input and output files are specified
   by the user (file extensions in the ACD file). A log file is also
   written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the protein CCF file is described in the PDBPARSE
   documentation.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The CON format used for the contact files (Figure 1) is similar to EMBL
   format and is described in the CONTACTS documentation. A few of the
   records differ in the SITES output compared to the CONTACTS output,
   however, so for the sake of clarity all records are described below.
     * XX - used for spacing and comments. The first line is bibliographic
       information and contains the text "Residue-ligand contact data (for
       domains)".
     * TY - type of contact. For CON files generated by SITES, 'LIGAND' is
       always given.
     * EX - experimental information. The value of the threshold contact
       distance is given as a floating point number after 'THRESH'. For
       CON files generated by SITES, a '.' is given after 'IGNORE', 'NMOD'
       and 'NCHA' (these records are used by the CONTACTS and INTERFACE
       applications and can be disregarded).
     * NE - number of entries in the file. For CON files generated by
       SITES, this is the number of unique ligands:domain pairs. Following
       the NE record, the file has a section for each entry containing
       records for entry number (EN), identifier codes (ID), ligand
       description (DE), polypeptide chain-specific data (CN), chain
       sequence information (S1) and number of contacts (NC), that
       together define the ligand:domain pair and its contacts.
     * EN - entry number. The number in brackets indicates the start of an
       entry (ligand:domain pair).
     * ID - identifier codes: (1) PDB: 4-character PDB identifier code.
       (2) DOM: 7-character domain identifier code from SCOP or CATH. (3)
       LIG: Ligand identifier (an abbreviation of its full name).
     * DE - Full name of the ligand, see HETPARSE documentation.
     * CN - polypeptide chain-specific data. Tokens delimiting data items
       are as follow. (1) MO: The model number (from the PDB file). '1' is
       always given for CON files generated by using SITES (contacts were
       calculated from the coordinates for a single model from a domain
       CCF file). (2) CN1: Chain number. '1' is always given (domains from
       a domain CCF file are always listed as from a single chain only).
       (3) CN2: Not used by SITES, a '.' is given. (4) ID1: PDB chain
       identifier (a '.` given in cases where a chain identifier was not
       specified in the original PDB file or, for domain CCF files, the
       domain from SCOP or CATH is comprised of more than one chain). (5)
       ID2: Not used by SITES, a '.' is given. (6) NRES1: number of
       residues in chain. (7) NRES2: Not used by SITES, a '.' is given.
     * S1 - polypeptide chain sequence for domain. The number of residues
       is given before AA on the first line. The sequece is given on
       subsequent lines.
     * NC - number of contacts: (1) SM: Not used by SITES, a '.' is given.
       (2) LI: Number of residue-ligand contacts; between side-chain or
       main-chain atoms of an amino acid residue and a ligand.
     * LI - Line of residue-ligand contact data. The amino acid identifier
       and residue number are given. Residue numbers are taken from the
       CCF file and give a correct index into the sequence (i.e. they are
       not necessarily the same as the original PDB file). This sequence
       is given in the CON file itself (S1 record).
     * // - delimiter for individual entries in the file and also given on
       the last line of the file.

5.0 DATA FILES

   SITES uses a data file containing van der Waals radii for atoms in
   proteins (see CONTACTS documentation.) The file Evdw.dat is such a data
   file and is part of the EMBOSS distribution.
   SITES uses a data file containing a dictionary of heterogen groups in
   PDB. This file may be generated by using HETPARSE and is part of the
   EMBOSS distribution. The file Ehet.dat is such a data file and is part
   of the EMBOSS distribution.

6.0 USAGE

                                  files) or DOMAINER (domains), contain
                                  'cleaned-up' data that is self-consistent
                                  and error-corrected. Records for residue

                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
