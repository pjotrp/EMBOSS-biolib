           value is chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when you
           are aligning protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix when 
           you are aligning nucleotide sequences. If you sequence 
           contains many small errors you should set a low gap opening 
           penalty (near zero) to avoid over-penalizing those errors."

    help: "The gap extension penalty is the score substracted when more
           spaces are added to an existing alignment gap.  Often a single 
           insertion or deletion affects multiple residues/nucleotides; 
           separate opening and extension penalties reduce the excessive 
           penalty such events would otherwise carry; generally the
           gap extension penalty should be significantly lower than
           the gap opening penalty."
